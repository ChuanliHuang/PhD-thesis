abstract = {Centromeric nucleosomes are at the interface of the chromosome and the kinetochore that connects to spindle microtubules in mitosis. The core centromeric nucleosome complex (CCNC) harbors the histone H3 variant, CENP-A, and its binding proteins, CENP-C (through its central domain; CD) and CENP-N (through its N-terminal domain; NT). CENP-C can engage nucleosomes through two domains: the CD and the CENP-C motif (CM). CENP-CCD is part of the CCNC by virtue of its high specificity for CENP-A nucleosomes and ability to stabilize CENP-A at the centromere. CENP-CCM is thought to engage a neighboring nucleosome, either one containing conventional H3 or CENP-A, and a crystal structure of a nucleosome complex containing two copies of CENP-CCM was reported. Recent structures containing a single copy of CENP-NNT bound to the CENP-A nucleosome in the absence of CENP-C were reported. Here, we find that one copy of CENP-N is lost for every two copies of CENP-C on centromeric chromatin just prior to kinetochore formation. We present the structures of symmetric and asymmetric forms of the CCNC that vary in CENP-N stoichiometry. Our structures explain how the central domain of CENP-C achieves its high specificity for CENP-A nucleosomes and how CENP-C and CENP-N sandwich the histone H4 tail. The natural centromeric DNA path in our structures corresponds to symmetric surfaces for CCNC assembly, deviating from what is observed in prior structures using artificial sequences. At mitosis, we propose that CCNC asymmetry accommodates its asymmetric connections at the chromosome/kinetochore interface. Video Abstract:[Figure presented]},

abstract = {CENP-A is an essential histone H3 variant that epigenetically marks the centromeric region of chromosomes. Here we show that CENP-A nucleosomes form characteristic clusters during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. 2D and 3D super-resolution microscopy and segmentation analysis reveal that these clusters encompass a globular rosette-like structure, which evolves into a more compact structure in late G1. The rosette-like clusters contain numerous CENP-A molecules and form a large cellular structure of ∼250–300 nm diameter with remarkably similar shapes for each centromere. Co-localization analysis shows that HJURP, the CENP-A chaperone, is located in the center of the rosette and serves as a nucleation point. The discovery of an HJURP-mediated CENP-A nucleation in human cells and its structural description provide important insights into the mechanism of CENP-A deposition and the organization of CENP-A chromatin in the centromeric region.},

@article{Anink-Groenen2014,
abstract = {Background: The activity of a single gene is influenced by the composition of the chromatin in which it is embedded. Nucleosome turnover, conformational dynamics, and covalent histone modifications each induce changes in the structure of chromatin and its affinity for regulatory proteins. The dynamics of histone modifications and the persistence of modification patterns for long periods are still largely unknown. Results: In this study, we present a stochastic mathematical model that describes the molecular mechanisms of histone modification pattern formation along a single gene, with non-phenomenological, physical parameters. We find that diffusion and recruitment properties of histone modifying enzymes together with chromatin connectivity allow for a rich repertoire of stochastic histone modification dynamics and pattern formation. We demonstrate that histone modification patterns at a single gene can be established or removed within a few minutes through diffusion and weak recruitment mechanisms of histone modification spreading. Moreover, we show that strong synergism between diffusion and weak recruitment mechanisms leads to nearly irreversible transitions in histone modification patterns providing stable patterns. In the absence of chromatin connectivity spontaneous and dynamic histone modification boundaries can be formed that are highly unstable, and spontaneous fluctuations cause them to diffuse randomly. Chromatin connectivity destabilizes this synergistic system and introduces bistability, illustrating state switching between opposing modification states of the model gene. The observed bistable long-range and localized pattern formation are critical effectors of gene expression regulation. Conclusion: This study illustrates how the cooperative interactions between regulatory proteins and the chromatin state generate complex stochastic dynamics of gene expression regulation.},

abstract = {Centromeric nucleosomes are composed of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A and the core histones H2A, H2B, and H4. To establish a functional kinetochore, histone H4 lysine-20 (H4K20) must be monomethylated, but the underlying mechanism has remained enigmatic. To provide structural insights into H4K20 methylation, we here solve the crystal structure of a nucleosome containing an H3.1-CENP-A chimera, H3.1 CATD , which has a CENP-A centromere targeting domain and preserves essential CENP-A functions in vivo. Compared to the canonical H3.1 nucleosome, the H3.1 CATD nucleosome exhibits conformational changes in the H4 N-terminal tail leading to a relocation of H4K20. In particular, the H4 N-terminal tail interacts with glutamine-76 and aspartate-77 of canonical H3.1 while these interactions are cancelled in the presence of the CENP-A-specific residues valine-76 and lysine-77. Mutations of valine-76 and lysine-77 impair H4K20 monomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that a CENP-A-mediated structural polymorphism may explain the preferential H4K20 monomethylation in centromeric nucleosomes.},

@article{Ariyoshi2021,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors The CENP-A nucleosome is a key structure for kinetochore assembly. Once the CENP-A nucleosome is established in the centromere, additional proteins recognize the CENP-A nucleosome to form a kinetochore. CENP-C and CENP-N are CENP-A binding proteins. We previously demonstrated that vertebrate CENP-C binding to the CENP-A nucleosome is regulated by CDK1-mediated CENP-C phosphorylation. However, it is still unknown how the phosphorylation of CENP-C regulates its binding to CENP-A. It is also not completely understood how and whether CENP-C and CENP-N act together on the CENP-A nucleosome. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in combination with biochemical approaches, we reveal a stable CENP-A nucleosome-binding mode of CENP-C through unique regions. The chicken CENP-C structure bound to the CENP-A nucleosome is stabilized by an intramolecular link through the phosphorylated CENP-C residue. The stable CENP-A-CENP-C complex excludes CENP-N from the CENP-A nucleosome. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the dynamic kinetochore assembly regulated by CDK1-mediated CENP-C phosphorylation.},

abstract = {The accurate regulation of phosphorylation at the kinetochore is essential for establishing chromosome bi-orientation. Phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by the Aurora B kinase destabilizes improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments, whereas the phosphatase PP2A has a counteracting role. Imbalanced phosphoregulation leads to error-prone chromosome segregation and aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer cells. However, little is known about the molecular events that control the balance of phosphorylation at the kinetochore. Here, we show that localization of SET/TAF1, an oncogene product, to centromeres maintains Aurora B kinase activity by inhibiting PP2A, thereby correcting erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachment. SET localizes at the inner centromere by interacting directly with shugoshin 2, with SET levels declining at increased distances between kinetochore pairs, leading to establishment of chromosome bi-orientation. Moreover, SET overexpression induces chromosomal instability by disrupting kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Thus, our findings reveal the novel role of SET in fine-tuning the phosphorylation level at the kinetochore by balancing the activities of Aurora B and PP2A.},

abstract = {Centromeres are chromosomal loci required for accurate segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis. The location of the centromere on the chromosome is not dependent on DNA sequence, but rather it is epigenetically specified by the histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). The N-terminal tail of CENP-A is highly divergent from other H3 variants. Canonical histone N termini are hotspots of conserved posttranslational modification; however, no broadly conserved modifications of the vertebrate CENP-A tail have been previously observed. Here, we report three posttranslational modifications on human CENP-A N termini using high-resolution MS: trimethylation of Gly1 and phosphorylation of Ser16 and Ser18. Our results demonstrate that CENP-A is subjected to constitutive initiating methionine removal, similar to other H3 variants. The nascent N-terminal residue Gly1 becomes trimethylated on the a-Amino group. We demonstrate that the N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase is capable of modifying the CENP-A N terminus. Methylation occurs in the prenucleosomal form and marks the majority of CENP-A nucleosomes. Serine 16 and 18 become phosphorylated in prenucleosomal CENP-A and are phosphorylated on asynchronous and mitotic nucleosomal CENP-A and are important for chromosome segregation during mitosis. The double phosphorylation motif forms a salt-bridged secondary structure and causes CENP-A N-terminal tails to form intramolecular associations. Analytical ultracentrifugation of phospho-mimetic CENP-A nucleosome arrays demonstrates that phosphorylation results in greater intranucleosome associations and counteracts the hyperoligomerized state exhibited by unmodified CENP-A nucleosome arrays. Our studies have revealed that the major modifications on the N-terminal tail of CENP-A alter the physical properties of the chromatin fiber at the centromere.},

abstract = {The centromere is the locus on the chromosome that acts as the essential connection point between the chromosome and the mitotic spindle. A histone H3 variant, CENP-A, defines the location of the centromere, but centromeric chromatin consists of a mixture of both CENP-A-containing and H3-containing nucleosomes. We report a surprisingly uniform pattern of primarily monomethylation on lysine 20 of histone H4 present in short polynucleosomes mixtures of CENP-A and H3 nucleosomes isolated from functional centromeres. Canonical H3 is not a component of CENP-A-containing nucleosomes at centromeres, so the H3 we copurify from these preparations comes exclusively from adjacent nucleosomes. We find that CENP-A-proximal H3 nucleosomes are not uniformly modified but contain a complex set of PTMs. Dually modified K9me2-K27me2 H3 nucleosomes are observed at the centromere. Side-chain acetylation of both histone H3 and histone H4 is low at the centromere. Prior to assembly at centromeres, newly expressed CENP-A is sequestered for a large portion of the cell cycle (late S-phase, G2, and most of mitosis) in a complex that contains its partner, H4, and its chaperone, HJURP. In contrast to chromatin associated centromeric histone H4, we show that prenucleosomal CENP-A-associated histone H4 lacks K20 methylation and contains side-chain and $\alpha$-amino acetylation. We show HJURP displays a complex set of serine phosphorylation that may potentially regulate the deposition of CENP-A. Taken together, our findings provide key information regarding some of the key components of functional centromeric chromatin.},

abstract = {Centromeres of higher eukaryotes are epigenetically marked by the centromere-specific CENP-A nucleosome. New CENP-A recruitment requires the CENP-A histone chaperone HJURP. In this paper, we show that a LacI (Lac repressor) fusion of HJURP drove the stable recruitment of CENP-A to a LacO (Lac operon) array at a noncentromeric locus. Ectopically targeted CENP-A chromatin at the LacO array was sufficient to direct the assembly of a functional centromere as indicated by the recruitment of the constitutive centromereassociated network proteins, the microtubule-binding protein NDC80, and the formation of stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments. An amino-terminal fragment of HJURP was able to assemble CENP-A nucleosomes in vitro, demonstrating that HJURP is a chromatin assembly factor. Furthermore, HJURP recruitment to endogenous centromeres required the Mis18 complex. Together, these data suggest that the role of the Mis18 complex in CENP-A deposition is to recruit HJURP and that the CENP-A nucleosome assembly activity of HJURP is responsible for centromeric chromatin assembly to maintain the epigenetic mark. {\textcopyright} 2011 Barnhart et al.},

abstract = {CENP-A is the histone H3 variant necessary to specify the location of all eukaryotic centromeres via its CENP-A targeting domain and either one of its terminal regions. In humans, several post-translational modifications occur on CENP-A, but their role in centromere function remains controversial. One of these modifications of CENP-A, phosphorylation on serine 7, has been proposed to control centromere assembly and function. Here, using gene targeting at both endogenous CENP-A alleles and gene replacement in human cells, we demonstrate that a CENP-A variant that cannot be phosphorylated at serine 7 maintains correct CENP-C recruitment, faithful chromosome segregation and long-term cell viability. Thus, we conclude that phosphorylation of CENP-A on serine 7 is dispensable to maintain correct centromere dynamics and function.},

abstract = {In recent years, various synthetic approaches have been developed to address the question of what directs centromere establishment and maintenance. In this chapter, we will discuss how approaches aimed at constructing synthetic centromeres have co-evolved with and contributed to shape the theory describing the determinants of centromere identity. We will first review lessons learned from artificial chromosomes created from "naked" centromeric sequences to investigate the role of the underlying DNA for centromere formation. We will then discuss how several studies, which applied removal of endogenous centromeres or over-expression of the centromere-specific histone CENP-A, helped to investigate the contribution of chromatin context to centromere establishment. Finally, we will examine various biosynthetic approaches taking advantage of targeting specific proteins to ectopic sites in the genome to dissect the role of many centromere-associated proteins and chromatin modifiers for centromere inheritance and function. Together, these studies showed that chromatin context matters, particularly proximity to heterochromatin or repetitive DNA sequences. Moreover, despite the important contribution of centromeric DNA, the centromere-specific histone H3-variant CENP-A emerges as a key epigenetic mark to establish and maintain functional centromeres on artificial chromosomes or at ectopic sites of the genome.},

Here we describe the proteome of Drosophila melanogaster centromeres as analyzed by quantitative affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS). The AP-MS input chromatin material was prepared from D. melanogaster cell lines expressing CENP-ACID or H3.3 fused to EGFP as baits.

The analysis yielded 86 proteins specifically enriched in centromere chromatin preparations.The data accompanying the manuscript on this approach (Barth et al., 2015, Proteomics 14:2167-78, DOI: 10.1002/pmic.201400052) has been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( http://www.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD000758.},

abstract = {Centromeres are chromosomal regions crucial for correct chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. They are epigenetically defined by centromeric proteins such as the centromere-specific histone H3-variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). In humans, 16 additional proteins have been described to be constitutively associated with centromeres throughout the cell cycle, known as the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN). In contrast, only one additional constitutive centromeric protein is known in Drosophila melanogaster (D.mel), the conserved CCAN member CENP-C. To gain further insights into D. mel centromere composition and biology, we analyzed affinity-purified chromatin prepared from D. mel cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein tagged histone three variants by MS. In addition to already-known centromeric proteins, we identified novel factors that were repeatedly enriched in affinity purification-MS experiments. We analyzed the cellular localization of selected candidates by immunocytochemistry and confirmed localization to the centromere and other genomic regions for ten factors. Furthermore, RNA interference mediated depletion of CG2051, CG14480, and hyperplastic discs, three of our strongest candidates, leads to elevated mitotic defects. Knockdowns of these candidates neither impair the localization of several known kinetochore proteins nor CENP-ACID loading, suggesting their involvement in alternative pathways that contribute to proper centromere function. In summary, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the proteomic composition of Drosophila centromeres. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000758 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD000758).},

abstract = {Centromeres are defined by the presence of chromatin containing the histone H3 variant, CENP-A, whose assembly into nucleosomes requires the chromatin assembly factor HJURP. We find that whereas surface-exposed residues in the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD) are the primary sequence determinants for HJURP recognition, buried CATD residues that generate rigidity with H4 are also required for efficient incorporation into centromeres. HJURP contact points adjacent to the CATD on the CENP-A surface are not used for binding specificity but rather to transmit stability broadly throughout the histone fold domains of both CENP-A and H4. Furthermore, an intact CENP-A/CENP-A interface is a requirement for stable chromatin incorporation immediately upon HJURP-mediated assembly. These data offer insight into the mechanism by which HJURP discriminates CENP-A from bulk histone complexes and chaperones CENP-A/H4 for a substantial portion of the cell cycle prior to mediating chromatin assembly at the centromere. Using a combination of cell-based and biophysical approaches, Bassett et al. show that HJURP, the chromatin assembly factor for centromere-specifying histone H3 variant CENP-A, recognizes specific discontinuous surface residues on the histone. HJURP binding confers stability to CENP-A/histone H4 and, together with an intact CENP-A/CENP-A interface, allows for centromere assembly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Centromeric chromatin is spatially delineated into the kinetochore-forming array of centromere protein A (CENP-A)-containing nucleosomes and the inner centromeric heterochromatin that lacks CENP-A but recruits the aurora B kinase that is necessary for correcting erroneous attachments to the mitotic spindle. We found that the self-perpetuating network of CENPs at the foundation of the kinetochore is intact at a human neocentromere lacking repetitive $\alpha$-satellite DNA. However, aurora B is inappropriately silenced as a consequence of the altered geometry of the neocentromere, thereby compromising the error correction mechanism. This suggests a model wherein the neocentromere represents a primordial inheritance locus that requires subsequent generation of a robust inner centromere compartment to enhance fidelity of chromosome transmission. {\textcopyright} 2010 Bassett et al.},

abstract = {The SDHD gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme and tumor suppressor, succinate dehydrogenase. Mutations in this gene show a remarkable pattern of parent-of-origin related tumorigenesis, with almost all SDHD-related cases of head and neck paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas attributable to paternally-transmitted mutations.Methods: Here we explore the underlying molecular basis of three cases of paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma that came to our attention due to apparent maternal transmission of an SDHD mutation. We used DNA analysis of family members to establish the mode of inheritance of each mutation. Genetic and immunohistochemical studies of available tumors were then carried out to confirm SDHD-related tumorigenesis.Results: We found convincing genetic and immunohistochemical evidence for the maternally-related occurrence of a case of pheochromocytoma, and suggestive evidence in a case of jugular paraganglioma. The third case appears to be a phenocopy, a sporadic paraganglioma in an SDHD mutation carrier with no immunohistochemical or DNA evidence to support a causal link between the mutation and the tumor. Microsatellite analysis in the tumor of patient 1 provided evidence for somatic recombination and loss of the paternal region of chromosome 11 including SDHD and the maternal chromosome including the centromere and the p arm.Conclusions: Transmission of SDHD mutations via the maternal line can, in rare cases, result in tumorigenesis. Despite this finding, the overwhelming majority of carriers of maternally-transmitted mutations will remain tumor-free throughout life.},

abstract = {Kinetochores assemble on distinct ' centrochromatin' containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A and interspersed nucleosomes dimethylated on H3K4 (H3K4me2). Little is known about how the chromatin environment at active centromeres governs centromeric structure and function. Here, we report that centrochromatin resembles K4-K36 domains found in the body of some actively transcribed housekeeping genes. By tethering the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), we specifically depleted H3K4me2, a modification thought to have a role in transcriptional memory, from the kinetochore of a synthetic human artificial chromosome (HAC). H3K4me2 depletion caused kinetochores to suffer a rapid loss of transcription of the underlying $\alpha$-satellite DNA and to no longer efficiently recruit HJURP, the CENP-A chaperone. Kinetochores depleted of H3K4me2 remained functional in the short term, but were defective in incorporation of CENP-A, and were gradually inactivated. Our data provide a functional link between the centromeric chromatin, $\alpha$-satellite transcription, maintenance of CENP-A levels and kinetochore stability. {\textcopyright} 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

What physical properties of CENP-A-containing complexes are important for epigenetically marking centromeres? What are the molecules that recognize centromeric chromatin and serve as the foundation for the mitotic kinetochore?

Centromeres are specified epigenetically, and the histone H3 variant CENP-A has emerged as the best candidate to carry the epigenetic centromere mark. Recent advances demonstrate the physical basis for this epigenetic mark whereby CENP-A confers conformational rigidity to the nucleosome it forms with other core histones. This nucleosome is recognized by a multisubunit complex of constitutive centromere proteins, termed the CENP-ANAC. Evidence from two CENP-A relatives in diverse eukaryotes suggests that the histone complexes they form adopt highly unconventional arrangements on DNA. Centromere identity, itself, is propagated during mitotic exit and early G1, and it relies upon a cis-acting targeting domain within CENP-A and a proposed centromere 'priming' reaction. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mammalian centromeres are defined epigenetically. Although the physical nature of the epigenetic mark is unknown, nucleosomes in which CENP-A replaces histone H3 are at the foundation of centromeric chromatin. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS is now used to show that assembly into nucleosomes imposes stringent conformational constraints, reducing solvent accessibility in almost all histone regions by >3 orders of magnitude. Despite this, nucleosomes assembled with CENP-A are substantially more conformationally rigid than those assembled with histone H3 independent of DNA template. Substitution of the CENP-A centromere targeting domain into histone H3 to convert it into a centromere-targeted histone that can functionally replace CENP-A in centromere maintenance generates the same more rigid nucleosome, as does CENP-A. Thus, the targeting information directing CENP-A deposition at the centromere produces a structurally distinct nucleosome, supporting a CENP-A-driven self-assembly mechanism that mediates maintenance of centromere identity. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

In all eukaryotes a hallmark of functional centromeres-both normal ones and those formed aberrantly at atypical loci-is the accumulation of centromere protein A (CENP-A), a histone variant that replaces H3 in centromeric nucleosomes. Here we show using deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry coupled with hydrodynamic measures that CENP-A and histone H4 form sub-nucleosomal tetramers that are more compact and conformationally more rigid than the corresponding tetramers of histones H3 and H4. Substitution into histone H3 of the domain of CENP-A responsible for compaction is sufficient to direct it to centromeres. Thus, the centromere-targeting domain of CENP-A confers a unique structural rigidity to the nucleosomes into which it assembles, and is likely to have a role in maintaining centromere identity.},

We now show in human cells and in yeast that depletion of CENP-A is lethal, but recruitment of normal levels of kinetochore proteins, centromere-generated mitotic checkpoint signaling, chromosome segregation, and viability can be rescued by histone H3 carrying the CATD.

abstract = {Centromeres are essential for chromosome segregation and are specified epigenetically by the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A. In flies and humans, replenishment of the centromeric mark is uncoupled from DNA replication and requires the removal of H3 "placeholder" nucleosomes. Although transcription at centromeres has been previously linked to the loading of new CENP-A, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster tissue culture cells to show that centromeric presence of actively transcribing RNA polymerase II temporally coincides with de novo deposition of dCENP-A. Using a newly developed dCENP-A loading system that is independent of acute transcription, we found that short inhibition of transcription impaired dCENP-A incorporation into chromatin. Interestingly, initial targeting of dCENP-A to centromeres was unaffected, revealing two stability states of newly loaded dCENP-A: a salt-sensitive association with the centromere and a salt-resistant chromatin-incorporated form. This suggests that transcription-mediated chromatin remodeling is required for the transition of dCENP-A to fully incorporated nucleosomes at the centromere.},

abstract = {Replication and transcription of genomic DNA requires partial disassembly of nucleosomes to allow progression of polymerases. This presents both an opportunity to remodel the underlying chromatin and a danger of losing epigenetic information. Centromeric transcription is required for stable incorporation of the centromere-specific histone dCENP-A in M/G1 phase, which depends on the eviction of previously deposited H3/H3.3-placeholder nucleosomes. Here we demonstrate that the histone chaperone and transcription elongation factor Spt6 spatially and temporarily coincides with centromeric transcription and prevents the loss of old CENP-A nucleosomes in both Drosophila and human cells. Spt6 binds directly to dCENP-A and dCENP-A mutants carrying phosphomimetic residues alleviate this association. Retention of phosphomimetic dCENP-A mutants is reduced relative to wildtype, while non-phosphorylatable dCENP-A retention is increased and accumulates at the centromere. We conclude that Spt6 acts as a conserved CENP-A maintenance factor that ensures long-term stability of epigenetic centromere identity during transcription-mediated chromatin remodeling.},

abstract = {The centromere, responsible for chromosome segregation during mitosis, is epigenetically defined by CENP-A containing chromatin. The amount of centromeric CENP-A has direct implications for both the architecture and epigenetic inheritance of centromeres. Using complementary strategies, we determined that typical human centromeres contain $\sim$400 molecules of CENP-A, which is controlled by a mass-action mechanism. This number, despite representing only $\sim$4% of all centromeric nucleosomes, forms a $\sim$50-fold enrichment to the overall genome. In addition, although pre-assembled CENP-A is randomly segregated during cell division, this amount of CENP-A is sufficient to prevent stochastic loss of centromere function and identity. Finally, we produced a statistical map of CENP-A occupancy at a human neocentromere and identified nucleosome positions that feature CENP-A in a majority of cells. In summary, we present a quantitative view of the centromere that provides a mechanistic framework for both robust epigenetic inheritance of centromeres and the paucity of neocentromere formation.},

abstract = {Centromeres are the site of kinetochore formation during mitosis. Centromere protein A (CENP-A), the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, is essential for the epigenetic maintenance of centromere position. Previously we showed that newly synthesized CENP-A is targeted to centromeres exclusively during early G1 phase and is subsequently maintained across mitotic divisions. Using SNAP-based fluorescent pulse labeling, we now demonstrate that cell cycle-restricted chromatin assembly at centromeres is unique to CENP-A nucleosomes and does not involve assembly of other H3 variants. Strikingly, stable retention is restricted to the CENP-A/H4 core of the nucleosome, which we find to outlast general chromatin across several cell divisions. We further show that cell cycle timing of CENP-A assembly is independent of centromeric DNA sequences and instead is mediated by the CENP-A targeting domain. Unexpectedly, this domain also induces stable transmission of centromeric nucleosomes, independent of the CENP-A deposition factor HJURP. This demonstrates that intrinsic properties of the CENP-A protein direct its cell cycle-restricted assembly and induces quantitative mitotic transmission of the CENP-A/H4 nucleosome core, ensuring long-term stability and epigenetic maintenance of centromere position. {\textcopyright} 2013 Bodor et al.},

abstract = {Mitotic fidelity is ensured by achieving biorientation on all paired chromosomes. The key signal for proper chromosome alignment is the tension between sister chromatids created by opposing poleward force from the spindles. In the budding yeast, the tension-sensing function requires that the Shugoshin protein, Shugoshin 1, be recruited to the centromeres and the neighboring pericentric regions. Concerted actions integrating proteins at centromeres and pericentromeres create highly specific Shugoshin 1 domains on mitotic chromosomes. We have previously reported that an important regulatory region on histone H3, termed the tension-sensing motif (TSM), is responsible for retaining Shugoshin 1 at pericentromeres. The TSM is negatively regulated by the acetyltransferase Gcn5p, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. In this work, we provide evidence that, when the TSM function is impaired, the histone H3 tail adopts a role that complements the damaged TSM to ensure faithful mitosis. This novel function of the H3 tail is controlled by Gcn5p, which targets selective lysine residues. Mutations to K14 and K23 ameliorate the mitotic defects resulting from TSM mutations. The restoration of faithful segregation is accompanied by regaining Shugoshin 1 access to the pericentric regions. Our data reveal a novel pathway for mitotic Shugoshin 1 recruitment and further reinforce the active role played by chromatins during their segregation in mitosis.},

A critical signal indicative of bipolar attachment is tension between cohesion-linked sister chromatids. Key components of the tension signaling apparatus include the Shugoshin family of proteins and the tension sensing motif of histone H3. Shugoshin proteins are recruited to chromatin to create discrete domains integral to tension sensing. Many factors involved in the chromatin association of Shugoshin proteins are well established, most strikingly through modifications found directly on centromeric and pericentric chromatin. It has been well established that phosphorylation at the centromere is essential to nucleating Shugoshin recruitment, but recent evidence revealed a role for pericentric histones and acetylation in modulating Shugoshin recruitment and activity. These data demonstrate that chromatins are not simply passive cargo during mitosis, but are instead actively involved in their segregation.},

CENP-A nucleosomes are thought to act as an epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity. We previously identified CENP-N as a CENP-A nucleosome-specific binding protein. Here, we show that CENP-C also binds directly and specifically to CENP-A nucleosomes. Nucleosome binding by CENP-C required the extreme C terminus of CENP-A and did not compete with CENP-N binding, which suggests that CENP-C and CENP-N recognize distinct structural elements of CENP-A nucleosomes. A mutation that disrupted CENP-C binding to CENP-A nucleosomes in vitro caused defects in CENP-C targeting to centromeres. Moreover, depletion of CENP-C with siRNA resulted in the mislocalization of all other nonhistone CENPs examined, including CENP-K, CENP-H, CENP-I, and CENP-T, and led to a partial reduction in centromeric CENP-A. We propose that CENP-C binds directly to CENP-A chromatin and, together with CENP-N, provides the foundation upon which other centromere and kinetochore proteins are assembled. {\textcopyright} 2010 Carroll et al.},

abstract = {Centromeres are specified epigenetically by the incorporation of the histone H3 variant CENP-A. In humans, amphibians, and fungi, CENP-A is deposited at centromeres by the HJURP/Scm3 family of assembly factors, but homologues of these chaperones are absent from a number of major eukaryotic lineages such as insects, fish, nematodes, and plants. In Drosophila, centromeric deposition of CENP-A requires the fly-specific protein CAL1. Here, we show that targeting CAL1 to noncentromeric DNA in Drosophila cells is sufficient to heritably recruit CENP-A, kinetochore proteins, and microtubule attachments. CAL1 selectively interacts with CENP-A and is sufficient to assemble CENP-A nucleosomes that display properties consistent with left-handed octamers. The CENP-A assembly activity of CAL1 resides within an N-terminal domain, whereas the C terminus mediates centromere recognition through an interaction with CENP-C. Collectively, this work identifies the "missing" CENP-A chaperone in flies, revealing fundamental conservation between insect and vertebrate centromerespecification mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Chen et al.},

abstract = {During meiosis, DNA replication is followed by 2 successive chromosome segregation events, resulting in the production of gametes with a haploid number of chromosomes from a diploid precursor cell. Faithful chromosome segregation in meiosis requires that sister chromatid cohesion is lost from chromosome arms during meiosis I, but retained at centromeric regions until meiosis II. Recent studies have begun to uncover the mechanisms underlying this stepwise loss of cohesion in meiosis and the role of a conserved protein, shugoshin, in regulating this process.

abstract = {Chromosome segregation is triggered by separase, an enzyme that eieaves cohesin, the protein complex that holds sister chromatids together. Separase activation requires the destruction of its inhibitor, securin, which occurs only upon the correct attachment of chromosomes to the spindle. However, other mechanisms restrict separase activity to the appropriate window in the cell cycle because cohesin is cleaved in a timely manner in securin- deficient cells. We investigated the mechanism by which the protector protein Shugoshin counteracts cohesin cleavage in budding yeast. We show that Shugoshin can prevent separase activation independently of securin. Instead, pp2A Cdc55 is essential for Shugoshin-mediated inhibition of separase. Loss of both securin and Cdc55 leads to premature sister chromatid separation, resulting in aneuploidy. We propose that Cdc55 is a separase inhibitor that acts downstream from Shugoshin under conditions where sister chromatids are not under tension. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {CENP-A is a histone variant that replaces conventional H3 in nucleosomes of functional centromeres. We report here, from reconstitutions of CENP-A- and H3-containing nucleosomes on linear DNA fragments and the comparison of their electrophoretic mobility, that CENP-A induces some positioning of its own and some unwrapping at the entry-exit relative to canonical nucleosomes on both 5 S DNA and the $\alpha$-satellite sequence on which it is normally loaded. This steady-state unwrapping was quantified to 7(±2) bp by nucleosome reconstitutions on a series of DNA minicircles, followed by their relaxation with topoisomerase I. The unwrapping was found to ease nucleosome invasion by exonuclease III, to hinder the binding of a linker histone, and to promote the release of an H2A-H2B dimer by nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP-1). The (CENP-A-H4)2 tetramer was also more readily destabilized with heparin than the (H3-H4)2 tetramer, suggesting that CENP-A has evolved to confer its nucleosome a specific ability to disassemble. This dual relative instability is proposed to facilitate the progressive clearance of CENP-A nucleosomes that assemble promiscuously in euchromatin, especially as is seen following CENP-A transient over-expression. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In higher organisms, all cells share the same genome, but every cell expresses only a limited and specific set of genes that defines the cell type. During cell division, not only the genome, but also the cell type is inherited by the daughter cells. This intriguing phenomenon is achieved by a variety of processes that have been collectively termed epigenetics: the stable and inheritable changes in gene expression patterns. This article reviews the extremely rich and exquisitely multiscale physical mechanisms that govern the biological processes behind the initiation, spreading, and inheritance of epigenetic states. These include not only the changes in the molecular properties associated with the chemical modifications of DNA and histone proteins, such as methylation and acetylation, but also less conventional changes, typically in the physics that governs the three-dimensional organization of the genome in cell nuclei. Strikingly, to achieve stability and heritability of epigenetic states, cells take advantage of many different physical principles, such as the universal behavior of polymers and copolymers, the general features of dynamical systems, and the electrostatic and mechanical properties related to chemical modifications of DNA and histones. By putting the complex biological literature in this new light, the emerging picture is that a limited set of general physical rules play a key role in initiating, shaping, and transmitting this crucial "epigenetic landscape." This new perspective not only allows one to rationalize the normal cellular functions, but also helps to understand the emergence of pathological states, in which the epigenetic landscape becomes dysfunctional.},

In most species, centromeres are epigenetically defined by the presence of a histone H3 variant CENP-A, independent of the underlying DNA sequence. Therefore, to maintain centromeres and ensure accurate chromosome segregation, CENP-A nucleosomes must be inherited across generations through the germline. In this chapter we discuss three aspects of maternal centromere inheritance. First, we propose mechanisms for maintaining CENP-A nucleosomes through the prolonged prophase arrest in mammalian oocytes. Second, we review mechanisms by which selfish centromeres bias their transmission through female meiosis. Third, we discuss regulation of centromere size through early embryonic development.},

In most species, centromeres are epigenetically defined by the presence of a histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A), independent of underlying DNA sequence. Therefore, centromere inheritance depends on maintaining the CENP-A nucleosome mark across generations. Experiments in cycling somatic cells have led to a model in which centromere identity is maintained by a cell cycle-coupled CENP-A chromatin assembly pathway. However, the processes of animal gametogenesis pose unique challenges to centromere inheritance because of the extended cell cycle arrest and the massive genome reorganization in the female and male germline, respectively. Here, we review our current understanding of germline centromere inheritance and highlight outstanding questions.},

abstract = {Maintenance of alternative chromatin states through cell divisions pose some fundamental constraints on the dynamics of histone modifications. In this paper, we study the systems biology of epigenetic inheritance by defining and analyzing general classes of mathematical models. We discuss how the number of modification states involved plays an essential role in the stability of epigenetic states. In addition, DNA duplication and the consequent dilution of marked histones act as a large perturbation for a stable state of histone modifications. The requirement that this large perturbation falls into the basin of attraction of the original state sometimes leads to additional constraints on effective models. Two such models, inspired by two different biological systems, are compared in their fulfilling the requirements of multistability and of recovery after DNA duplication. We conclude that in the presence of multiple histone modifications that characterize alternative epigenetic stable states, these requirements are more easily fulfilled. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is key to faithful segregation of chromosomes. One requirement that satisfies SAC is appropriate tension between sister chromatids at the metaphase-anaphase juncture. Proper tension generated by poleward pulling of mitotic spindles signals biorientation of the underlying chromosome. In the budding yeast, the tension status is monitored by the conserved Shugoshin protein, Sgo1p, and the tension sensing motif (TSM) of histone H3. ChIP-seq reveals a unique TSMdependent, tripartite domain of Sgo1p in each mitotic chromosome. This domain consists of one centromeric and two flanking peaks 3 - 4 kb away, present exclusively in mitosis. Strikingly, this trident motif coincides with cohesin localization, but only at the centromere and the two immediate adjacent loci, despite that cohesin is enriched at numerous regions throughout mitotic chromosomes. Chromosome conformation capture assays reveal apparent looping at the centromeric and pericentric regions. The TSM-Sgo1p-cohesin triad is therefore at the center stage of higher-ordered chromatin architecture for error-free segregation.},

abstract = {Chromosomal regions can adopt stable and heritable alternative states resulting in bistable gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence. Such epigenetic control is often associated with alternative covalent modifications of histones. The stability and heritability of the states are thought to involve positive feedback where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that similarly modify nearby nucleosomes. We developed a simplified stochastic model for dynamic nucleosome modification based on the silent mating-type region of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that the mechanism can give strong bistability that is resistant both to high noise due to random gain or loss of nucleosome modifications and to random partitioning upon DNA replication. However, robust bistability required: (1) cooperativity, the activity of more than one modified nucleosome, in the modification reactions and (2) that nucleosomes occasionally stimulate modification beyond their neighbor nucleosomes, arguing against a simple continuous spreading of nucleosome modification. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Positive feedback in nucleosome modification has been proposed to allow large chromatin regions to exist stably and heritably in distinct expression states. However, modeling has shown that such epigenetic bistability requires that modifying enzymes recruited by nucleosomes are active on distant nucleosomes, potentially allowing uncontrollable spreading of modification. By modeling the silencing of mating-type loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that a modification reaction that combines a long-range component and a locally acting component can provide bistability and can be blocked by simple barriers that interrupt the nucleosome chain. We find that robust containment of the silenced region could be achieved by the presence of a number of weak simple barriers in the surrounding chromatin and a limited capacity of the positive feedback reaction. In addition, we show that the state of the silenced region can be regulated by silencer elements acting only on neighboring nucleosomes. Thus, a relatively simple set of nucleosome-modifying enzymes and recognition domains is all that is needed to make chromatin-based epigenetics useful and safe. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The overall experimental observation is chromatin-based epigenetics, which in our formulation equates to bistable systems that faithfully maintain their alternative chromatin states across the disruptive events of cell division. We will see that the presence of such multistable systems requires ultrasensitivity and a positive feedback that acts beyond nearest neighbors.

abstract = {Centromere Protein A (CENP-A) is a histone H3 variant found at mammalian centromeres. Unlike canonical histones which are incorporated at centromeres in S phase, CENP-A is deposited at centromeric chromatin in G1. Although recent studies have elucidated many of the molecular details associated with the CENP-A incorporation pathway, some aspects of the process are still not fully understood. CENP-A incorporation in G1 requires multiple assembly factors for its recruitment and maintenance. In this study, the first mathematical model of the CENP-A incorporation pathway is developed. The model is based on what is currently known about the pathway and is calibrated by comparing numerical simulations with experimental observations taken from the literature. The model succinctly collates a large body of knowledge accumulated in recent decades concerning the pathway and produces results that are consistent with experimental findings. It identifies possible gaps in what is currently known about the pathway and suggests possible directions for future research. It is envisaged that the model will be expanded upon and improved as more information concerning the pathway comes to light. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Faithful chromosome segregation during cell division depends on the centromere, a complex DNA/protein structure that links chromosomes to spindle microtubules. This chromosomal domain has to be marked throughout cell division and its chromosomal localization preserved across cell generations. From fission yeast to human, centromeres are established on a series of repetitive DNA sequences and on specialized centromeric chromatin. This chromatin is enriched with the histone H3 variant, named CENP-A, that was demonstrated to be the epigenetic mark that maintains centromere identity and function indefinitely. Although centromere identity is thought to be exclusively epigenetic, the presence of specific DNA sequences in the majority of eukaryotes and of the centromeric protein CENP-B that binds to these sequences, suggests the existence of a genetic component as well. In this review, we will highlight the importance of centromeric sequences for centromere formation and function, and discuss the centromere DNA sequence/CENP-B paradox.},

abstract = {Intrinsic genomic features of individual chromosomes can contribute to chromosome-specific aneuploidy. Centromeres are key elements for the maintenance of chromosome segregation fidelity via a specialized chromatin marked by CENP-A wrapped by repetitive DNA. These long stretches of repetitive DNA vary in length among human chromosomes. Using CENP-A genetic inactivation in human cells, we directly interrogate if differences in the centromere length reflect the heterogeneity of centromeric DNA-dependent features and whether this, in turn, affects the genesis of chromosome-specific aneuploidy. Using three distinct approaches, we show that mis-segregation rates vary among different chromosomes under conditions that compromise centromere function. Whole-genome sequencing and centromere mapping combined with cytogenetic analysis, small molecule inhibitors, and genetic manipulation revealed that inter-chromosomal heterogeneity of centromeric features, but not centromere length, influences chromosome segregation fidelity. We conclude that faithful chromosome segregation for most of human chromosomes is biased in favor of centromeres with high abundance of DNA-dependent centromeric components. These inter-chromosomal differences in centromere features can translate into non-random aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer and genetic diseases.},

abstract = {The histone H3 variant CenH3, called CENP-A in humans, is central in centromeric chromatin to ensure proper chromosome segregation. In the absence of an underlying DNA sequence, it is still unclear how CENP-A deposition at centromeres is determined. Here, we purified non-nucleosomal CENP-A complexes to identify direct CENP-A partners involved in such a mechanism and identified HJURP. HJURP was not detected in H3.1- or H3.3-containing complexes, indicating its specificity for CENP-A. HJURP centromeric localization is cell cycle regulated, and its transient appearance at the centromere coincides precisely with the proposed time window for new CENP-A deposition. Furthermore, HJURP downregulation leads to a major reduction in CENP-A at centromeres and impairs deposition of newly synthesized CENP-A, causing mitotic defects. We conclude that HJURP is a key factor for CENP-A deposition and maintenance at centromeres. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

HDAC3 knockdown induced spindle assembly checkpoint activation and sister chromatid dissociation. The depletion of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) or Aurora B restored cohesion in HDAC3-depleted cells. HDAC3 was also required for Shugoshin localization at centromeres. Finally, we show that HDAC3 depletion results in the acetylation of centromeric H3K4, correlated with a loss of dimethylation at the same position.

abstract = {Sister chromatid bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle is essential for proper chromosome segregation. Defects in bi-orientation are sensed and corrected to prevent chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. This response depends on the adaptor protein Sgo1, which associates with pericentromeric chromatin in mitosis. The mechanisms underlying Sgo1 function and regulation are unclear. Here, we show that Sgo1 is an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) substrate in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and that its mitotic destruction depends on an unusual D-box-related sequence motif near its Cterminus. We find that the removal of Sgo1 from chromosomes before anaphase is not dependent on its destruction, but rather on other mechanisms responsive to tension between sister chromatids. Additionally, we find that Sgo1 recruits the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) isoform containing Rts1 to the pericentromeric region prior to bi-orientation, and that artificial recruitment of Rts1 to this region of a single chromosome is sufficient to perform the function of Sgo1 on that chromosome. We conclude that in early mitosis, Sgo1 associates transiently with pericentromeric chromatin to promote biorientation, in large part by recruiting the Rts1 isoform of PP2A.},

Using gene targeting in human cells and fission yeast, chromatin containing the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A is demonstrated to be the epigenetic mark that acts through a two-step mechanism to identify, maintain and propagate centromere function indefinitely. Initially, centromere position is replicated and maintained by chromatin assembled with the centromere-targeting domain (CATD) of CENP-A substituted into H3. Subsequently, nucleation of kinetochore assembly onto CATD-containing chromatin is shown to require either the amino- or carboxy-terminal tail of CENP-A for recruitment of inner kinetochore proteins, including stabilizing CENP-B binding to human centromeres or direct recruitment of CENP-C, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Nevertheless, natural human centromeres are positioned within specific megabase chromosomal regions containing $\alpha$-satellite DNA repeats, which contain binding sites for the DNA sequence-specific binding protein CENP-B. We now demonstrate that CENP-B directly binds both CENP-A's amino-terminal tail and CENP-C, a key nucleator of kinetochore assembly. DNA sequence-dependent binding of CENP-B within $\alpha$-satellite repeats is required to stabilize optimal centromeric levels of CENP-C. Chromosomes bearing centromeres without bound CENP-B, including the human Y chromosome, are shown to mis-segregate in cells at rates several-fold higher than chromosomes withCENP-B-containing centromeres.

abstract = {CENP-A is a histone H3 variant key to epigenetic specification of mammalian centromeres. Using transient overexpression of CENP-A mutants, two recent reports in Developmental Cell proposed essential centromere functions for post-translational modifications of human CENP-A. Phosphorylation at Ser68 was proposed to have an essential role in CENP-A deposition at centromeres. Blockage of ubiquitination at Lys124 was proposed to abrogate localization of CENP-A to the centromere. Following gene inactivation and replacement in human cells, we demonstrate that CENP-A mutants that cannot be phosphorylated at Ser68 or ubiquitinated at Lys124 assemble efficiently at centromeres during G1, mediate early events in centromere establishment at an ectopic chromosomal locus, and maintain centromere function indefinitely. Thus, neither Ser68 nor Lys124 post-translational modification is essential for long-term centromere identity, propagation, cell-cycle-dependent deposition, maintenance, function, or mediation of early steps in centromere establishment.},

abstract = {Inheritance of each chromosome depends upon its centromere. A histone H3 variant, centromere protein A (CENP-A), is essential for epigenetically marking centromere location. We find that CENP-A is quantitatively retained at the centromere upon which it is initially assembled. CENP-C binds to CENP-A nucleosomes and is a prime candidate to stabilize centromeric chromatin. Using purified components, we find that CENP-C reshapes the octameric histone core of CENP-A nucleosomes, rigidifies both surface and internal nucleosome structure, and modulates terminal DNA to match the loose wrap that is found on native CENP-A nucleosomes at functional human centromeres. Thus, CENP-C affects nucleosome shape and dynamics in a manner analogous to allosteric regulation of enzymes. CENP-C depletion leads to rapid removal of CENP-A from centromeres, indicating their collaboration in maintaining centromere identity.},

abstract = {The histone H3 variant CENP-A is incorporated into nucleosomes that mark centromere location. We have recently reported that CENP-A nucleosomes, compared with their H3 counterparts, confer an altered nucleosome shape. Here, using a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach with recombinant human histones and centromere DNA, we found that the nucleosome shape change directed by CENP-A is dominated by lateral passing of two DNA gyres (gyre sliding). A nonhistone centromere protein, CENP-C, binds and reshapes the nucleosome, sliding the DNA gyres back to positions similar to those in canonical nucleosomes containing conventional histone H3. The model that we generated to explain the CENP-A-nucleosome transition provides an example of a shape change imposed by external binding proteins and has notable implications for understanding of the epigenetic basis of the faithful inheritance of centromere location on chromosomes.},

Mammalian centromeres are specified epigenetically, with all active centromeres containing centromere-specific chromatin in which CENP-A replaces histone H3 within the nucleosome. The proteins responsible for assembly of human CENP-A into centromeric nucleosomes during the G1 phase of the cell cycle are shown here to be distinct from the chromatin assembly factors previously shown to load other histone H3 variants. Here we demonstrate that prenucleosomal CENP-A is complexed with histone H4, nucleophosmin 1, and HJURP. Recruitment of new CENP-A into nucleosomes at replicated centromeres is dependent on HJURP. Recognition by HJURP is mediated through the centromere targeting domain (CATD) of CENP-A, a region that we demonstrated previously to induce a unique conformational rigidity to both the subnucleosomal CENP-A heterotetramer and the corresponding assembled nucleosome. We propose HJURP to be a cell-cycle-regulated CENP-A-specific histone chaperone required for centromeric chromatin assembly. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The basic element for chromosome inheritance, the centromere, is epigenetically determined in mammals. The prime candidate for specifying centromere identity is the array of nucleosomes assembled with CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant. Here, we show that CENP-A nucleosomes directly recruit a proximal CENP-A nucleosome associated complex (NAC) comprised of three new human centromere proteins (CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T), along with CENP-U(50), CENPC and CENP-H. Assembly of the CENP-A NAC at centromeres is dependent on CENP-M, CENP-N and CENP-T. Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) and nucleophosmin-1 (previously implicated in transcriptional chromatin remodelling and as a multifunctional nuclear chaperone, respectively) are absent from histone H3-containing nucleosomes, but are stably recruited to CENP-A nucleosomes independent of CENP-A NAC. Seven new CENP-A-nucleosome distal (CAD) centromere components (CENP-K, CENP-L, CENP-O, CENP-P, CENP-Q, CENP-R and CENP-S) are identified as assembling on the CENP-A NAC. The CENP-A NAC is essential, as disruption of the complex causes errors of chromosome alignment and segregation that preclude cell survival despite continued centromere-derived mitotic checkpoint signalling. {\textcopyright} 2006, Nature Publishing Group Ltd.

abstract = {The centromere is a critical genomic region that enables faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis, and must be distinguishable from other genomic regions to facilitate establishment of the kinetochore. The centromere-specific histone H3-variant CENP-A forms a special nucleosome that functions as a marker for centromere specification. In addition to the CENP-A nucleosomes, there are additional H3 nucleosomes that have been identified in centromeres, both of which are predicted to exhibit specific features. It is likely that the composite organization of CENP-A and H3 nucleosomes contributes to the formation of centromere-specific chromatin, termed ‘centrochromatin'. Recent studies suggest that centrochromatin has specific histone modifications that mediate centromere specification and kinetochore assembly. We use chicken non-repetitive centromeres as a model of centromeric activities to characterize functional features of centrochromatin. This review discusses our recent progress, and that of various other research groups, in elucidating the functional roles of histone modifications in centrochromatin.},

abstract = {The kinetochore is formed on centromeric DNA as a key interface with microtubules from the mitotic spindle to achieve accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. However, in contrast to other regions of the chromosome, the position of the kinetochore is specified by sequence-independent epigenetic mechanisms. Most recent work on kinetochore specification has focused on the centromere-specific histone H3-variant CENP-A. Whereas CENP-A is an important epigenetic marker for the kinetochore specification, it is unclear how centromeric chromatin structure is organized. To understand centromeric chromatin structure, we focused on additional centromere proteins that have an intrinsic DNA binding activity and identified the DNA binding CENP-T-W-S-X complex. Tetramer formation of CENP-T-W-S-X is essential for functional kinetochore assembly in vertebrate cells. Our structural and biochemical analysis reveals that the CENPT-W-S-X complex is composed of four histone-fold domains with structural similarity to nucleosomes and displays DNA supercoiling activity. These results suggest that the CENP-T-W-S-X complex forms a unique nucleosome-like structure at centromeric chromatin. In addition, CENP-S and CENP-X function at non-centromeric sites. The intriguing histone-like properties of these proteins suggest that they may form nucleosome-like structures at various genome loci, extending the chromatin code beyond classical histone variants. {\textcopyright} 2012 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {CENP-H has recently been discovered as a constitutive component of the centromere that co-localizes with CENP-A and CENP-C throughout the cell cycle. The precise function, however, remains poorly understood. We examined the role of CENP-H in centromere function and assembly by generating a conditional loss-of-function mutant in the chicken DT40 cell line. In the absence of CENP-H, cell cycle arrest at metaphase, consistent with loss of centromere function, was observed. Immunocytochemical analysis of the CENP-H-deficient cells demonstrated that CENP-H is necessary for CENP-C, but not CENP-A, localization to the centromere. These findings indicate that centromere assembly in vertebrate cells proceeds in a hierarchical manner in which localization of the centromere-specific histone CENP-A is an early event that occurs independently of CENP-C and CENP-H.},

abstract = {RNA interference is an evolutionarily conserved gene-silencing pathway in which the nuclease Dicer cleaves double-stranded RNA into small interfering RNAs1. The biological function of the RNAi-related pathway in vertebrate cells is not fully understood. Here, we report the generation of a conditional loss-of-function Dicer mutant in a chicken-human hybrid DT40 cell line that contains human chromosome 21. We show that loss of Dicer results in cell death with the accumulation of abnormal mitotic cells that show premature sister chromatid separation. Aberrant accumulation of transcripts from $\alpha$ -satellite sequences, which consist of human centromeric repeat DNAs, was detected in Dicer-deficient cells. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed abnormalities in the localization of two heterochromatin proteins, Rad21 cohesin protein and BubR1 checkpoint protein, but the localization of core kinetochore proteins such as centromere protein (CENP)-A and -C was normal. We conclude that Dicer-related RNA interference machinery is involved in the formation of the heterochromatin structure in higher vertebrate cells.},

abstract = {Meiosis produces gametes through a specialized, two-step cell division, which is highly error prone in humans. Reductional meiosis I, where maternal and paternal chromosomes (homologs) segregate, is followed by equational meiosis II, where sister chromatids separate. Uniquely during meiosis I, sister kinetochores are monooriented and pericentromeric cohesin is protected. Here, we demonstrate that these key adaptations for reductional chromosome segregation are achieved through separable control of multiple kinases by the meiosis-I-specific budding yeast Spo13 protein. Recruitment of Polo kinase to kinetochores directs monoorientation, while independently, cohesin protection is achieved by containing the effects of cohesin kinases. Therefore, reductional chromosome segregation, the defining feature of meiosis, is established by multifaceted kinase control by a master regulator. The recent identification of Spo13 orthologs, fission yeast Moa1 and mouse MEIKIN, suggests that kinase coordination by a meiosis I regulator may be a general feature in the establishment of reductional chromosome segregation. Segregation of homologs—rather than sister chromatids—is unique to meiosis I. Galander et al. show that the meiosis-I-specific Spo13 protein prevents sister chromatid segregation by controlling the effects of multiple kinases to both enforce sister kinetochore co-orientation and prevent premature loss of cohesion.},

abstract = {Proper segregation of chromosomes is an essential component of cell division. The centromere is the locus at which the kinetochore-the proteinaceous complex that ties chromosomes to microtubules-forms during mitosis and meiosis. Thus, the centromere is critical for equal segregation of chromosomes. The centromere is characterized by both protein and DNA elements: The histone H3 variant CENP-A epigenetically defines the location of the centromere while centromeric DNA sequences are neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere function. Paradoxically, the DNA sequences play a critical role in new centromere formation. In this essay, we discuss the contribution of both epigenetics and genetics at the centromere. Understanding these contributions is vital to efforts to control centromere formation on synthetic/artificial chromosomes and centromere strength on natural ones.},

abstract = {Centromeres are essential components of all eukaryotic chromosomes, including artificial/synthetic ones built in the laboratory. In humans, centromeres are typically located on repetitive $\alpha$-satellite DNA, and these sequences are the “major ingredient” in first-generation human artificial chromosomes (HACs). Repetitive centromeric sequences present a major challenge for the design of synthetic mammalian chromosomes because they are difficult to synthesize, assemble, and characterize. Additionally, in most eukaryotes, centromeres are defined epigenetically. Here, we review the role of the genetic and epigenetic contributions to establishing centromere identity, highlighting recent work to hijack the epigenetic machinery to initiate centromere identity on a new generation of HACs built without $\alpha$-satellite DNA. We also discuss the opportunities and challenges in developing useful unique sequence-based HACs.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation requires assembly of the multiprotein kinetochore complex at centromeres. Although prior work identified the centromeric histone H3-variant CENP-A as the important upstream factor necessary for centromere specification, in human cells CENP-A is not sufficient for kinetochore assembly. Here, we demonstrate that two constitutive DNA-binding kinetochore components, CENP-C and CENP-T, function to direct kinetochore formation. Replacing the DNA-binding regions of CENP-C and CENP-T with alternate chromosome-targeting domains recruits these proteins to ectopic loci, resulting in CENP-A-independent kinetochore assembly. These ectopic kinetochore-like foci are functional based on the stoichiometric assembly of multiple kinetochore components, including the microtubule-binding KMN network, the presence of microtubule attachments, the microtubule-sensitive recruitment of the spindle checkpoint protein Mad2, and the segregation behavior of foci-containing chromosomes. We additionally find that CENP-T phosphorylation regulates the mitotic assembly of both endogenous and ectopic kinetochores. Thus, CENP-C and CENP-T form a critical regulated platform for vertebrate kinetochore assembly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Summary The centromeric histone H3 variant centromeric protein A (CENP-A), whose sequence is the least conserved among all histone variants, is responsible for specifying the location of the centromere. Here, we present a comprehensive study of CENP-A nucleosome arrays by cryo-electron tomography. We see that CENP-A arrays have different biophysical properties than canonical ones under low ionic conditions, as they are more condensed with a 20% smaller average nearest-neighbor distance and a 30% higher nucleosome density. We find that CENP-A nucleosomes have a predominantly crossed DNA entry/exit site that is narrowed on average by 8, and they have a propensity to stack face to face. We therefore propose that CENP-A induces geometric constraints at the nucleosome DNA entry/exit site to bring neighboring nucleosomes into close proximity. This specific property of CENP-A may be responsible for generating a fundamental process that contributes to increased chromatin fiber compaction that is propagated under physiological conditions to form centromeric chromatin. {\textcopyright} 2014 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Maintaining centromere identity relies upon the persistence of the epigenetic mark provided by the histone H3 variant, centromere protein A (CENP-A), but the molecular mechanisms that underlie its remarkable stability remain unclear. Here, we define the contributions of each of the three candidate CENP-A nucleosome-binding domains (two on CENP-C and one on CENP-N) to CENP-A stability using gene replacement and rapid protein degradation. Surprisingly, the most conserved domain, the CENP-C motif, is dispensable. Instead, the stability is conferred by the unfolded central domain of CENP-C and the folded N-terminal domain of CENP-N that becomes rigidified 1,000-fold upon crossbridging CENP-A and its adjacent nucleosomal DNA. Disrupting the 'arginine anchor' on CENP-C for the nucleosomal acidic patch disrupts the CENP-A nucleosome structural transition and removes CENP-A nucleosomes from centromeres. CENP-A nucleosome retention at centromeres requires a core centromeric nucleosome complex where CENP-C clamps down a stable nucleosome conformation and CENP-N fastens CENP-A to the DNA.},

abstract = {During cell division, chromosomes are segregated to nascent daughter cells by attaching to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle through the kinetochore. Kinetochores are assembled on a specialized chromatin domain called the centromere, which is characterized by the replacement of nucleosomal histone H3 with the histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). CENP-A is essential for centromere and kinetochore formation in all eukaryotes but it is unknown how CENP-A chromatin directs centromere and kinetochore assembly. Here we generate synthetic CENP-A chromatin that recapitulates essential steps of centromere and kinetochore assembly in vitro. We show that reconstituted CENP-A chromatin when added to cell-free extracts is sufficient for the assembly of centromere and kinetochore proteins, microtubule binding and stabilization, and mitotic checkpoint function. Using chromatin assembled from histone H3/CENP-A chimaeras, we demonstrate that the conserved carboxy terminus of CENP-A is necessary and sufficient for centromere and kinetochore protein recruitment and function but that the CENP-A targeting domain-required for new CENP-A histone assembly-is not. These data show that two of the primary requirements for accurate chromosome segregation, the assembly of the kinetochore and the propagation of CENP-A chromatin, are specified by different elements in the CENP-A histone. Our unique cell-free system enables complete control and manipulation of the chromatin substrate and thus presents a powerful tool to study centromere and kinetochore assembly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Orderly termination of sister-chromatid cohesion during mitosis is critical for accurate chromosome segregation. During prophase, mitotic kinases phosphorylate cohesin and its protector sororin, triggering Wapl-dependent cohesin release from chromosome arms. The shugoshin (Sgo1)-PP2A complex protects centromeric cohesin until its cleavage by separase at anaphase onset. Here, we report the crystal structure of a human cohesin subcomplex comprising SA2 and Scc1. Multiple HEAT repeats of SA2 form a dragon-shaped structure. Scc1 makes extensive contacts with SA2, with one binding hotspot. Sgo1 and Wapl compete for binding to a conserved site on SA2-Scc1. At this site, mutations of SA2 residues that disrupt Wapl binding bypass the Sgo1 requirement in cohesion protection. Thus, in addition to recruiting PP2A to dephosphorylate cohesin and sororin, Sgo1 physically shields cohesin from Wapl. This unexpected, direct antagonism between Sgo1 and Wapl augments centromeric cohesion protection.},

abstract = {The centromere is the chromosomal locus that ensures fidelity in genome transmission at cell division. Centromere protein A (CENP-A) is a histone H3 variant that specifies centromere location independently of DNA sequence. Conflicting evidence has emerged regarding the histone composition and stoichiometry of CENP-A nucleosomes. Here we show that the predominant form of the CENP-A particle at human centromeres is an octameric nucleosome. CENP-A nucleosomes are very highly phased on $\alpha$-satellite 171-base-pair monomers at normal centromeres and also display strong positioning at neocentromeres. At either type of functional centromere, CENP-A nucleosomes exhibit similar DNA-wrapping behavior, as do octameric CENP-A nucleosomes reconstituted with recombinant components, having looser DNA termini than those on conventional nucleosomes containing canonical histone H3. Thus, the fundamental unit of the chromatin that epigenetically specifies centromere location in mammals is an octameric nucleosome with loose termini. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Posttranslational histone modifications are important for gene regulation, yet the mode of propagation and the contribution to heritable gene expression states remains controversial. To address these questions, we developed a chromatin in vivo assay (CiA) system employing chemically induced proximity to initiate and terminate chromatin modifications in living cells. We selectively recruited HP1$\alpha$ to induce H3K9me3-dependent gene silencing and describe the kinetics and extent of chromatin modifications at the Oct4 locus in fibroblasts and pluripotent cells. H3K9me3 propagated symmetrically and continuously at average rates of ∼0.18 nucleosomes/hr to produce domains of up to 10 kb. After removal of the HP1$\alpha$ stimulus, heterochromatic domains were heritably transmitted, undiminished through multiple cell generations. Our data enabled quantitative modeling of reaction kinetics, which revealed that dynamic competition between histone marking and turnover, determines the boundaries and stability of H3K9me3 domains. This framework predicts the steady-state dynamics and spatial features of the majority of euchromatic H3K9me3 domains over the genome. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Aurora-B kinases are important regulators of mitotic chromosome segregation, where they are required for the faithful bi-orientation of sister chromatids. In contrast to mitosis, sister chromatids have to be oriented toward the same spindle pole in meiosis-I, while homologous chromosomes are bi-oriented. We find that the fission yeast Aurora kinase Ark1 is required for the faithful bi-orientation of sister chromatids in mitosis and of homologous chromosomes in meiosis-I. Unexpectedly, Ark1 is also necessary for the faithful mono-orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis-I, even though the canonical mono-orientation pathway, which depends on Moa1 and Rec8, seems intact. Our data suggest that Ark1 prevents unified sister kinetochores during metaphase-I from merotelic attachment to both spindle poles and thus from being torn apart during anaphase-I, revealing a novel mechanism promoting monopolar attachment. Furthermore, our results provide an explanation for the previously enigmatic observation that fission yeast Shugoshin Sgo2, which assists in loading Aurora to centromeres, and its regulator Bub1 are required for the mono-orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis-I. {\textcopyright}2007 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

abstract = {The centromere-specific histone variant CENP-A (CID in Drosophila) is a structural and functional foundation for kinetochore formation and chromosome segregation. Here, we show that overexpressed CID is mislocalized into normally noncentromeric regions in Drosophila tissue culture cells and animals. Analysis of mitoses in living and fixed cells reveals that mitotic delays, anaphase bridges, chromosome fragmentation, and cell and organismal lethality are all direct consequences of CID mislocalization. In addition, proteins that are normally restricted to endogenous kinetochores assemble at a subset of ectopic CID incorporation regions. The presence of microtubule motors and binding proteins, spindle attachments, and aberrant chromosome morphologies demonstrate that these ectopic kinetochores are functional. We conclude that CID mislocalization promotes formation of ectopic centromeres and multicentric chromosomes, which causes chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy, and growth defects. Thus, CENP-A mislocalization is one possible mechanism for genome instability during cancer progression, as well as centromere plasticity during evolution. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A central goal of chromatin biology is to reveal how posttranslational histone marks modulate gene expression; however, relatively little is known about the spatial or temporal dynamics of these marks. We previously showed that a dynamic model of histone mark nucleation, propagation, and turnover fits the mean enrichment profiles from 99% of noncentromeric histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) domains in mouse embryonic stem cells without the need for boundary or insulator elements. Here we report the full details of this "inherently bounded" model of histone modification dynamics and describe several dynamic features of the model using H3K9me3 as a paradigm. By analyzing the kinetic and structural constraints that drive formation of inherently bounded domains, we find that such domains are optimized when the rates of marking and turnover are comparable. Additionally, we find that to establish such domains, propagation of the histone marks must occur primarily through local contacts.},

By inducing rapid, complete degradation of endogenous CENP-A, we now demonstrate that once the first steps of centromere assembly have been completed in G1/S, continued CENP-A binding is not required for maintaining kinetochore attachment to centromeres or for centromere function in the next mitosis. Degradation of CENP-A prior to kinetochore assembly is found to block deposition of CENP-C and CENP-N, but not CENP-T, thereby producing defective kinetochores and failure of chromosome segregation. Without the continuing presence of CENP-A, CENP-B binding to alphoid DNA sequences becomes essential to preserve anchoring of CENP-C and the kinetochore to each centromere. Thus, there is a reciprocal interdependency of CENP-A chromatin and the underlying repetitive centromere DNA sequences bound by CENP-B in the maintenance of human chromosome segregation.},

abstract = {Centromeres are built on repetitive DNA sequences (CenDNA) and a specific chromatin enriched with the histone H3 variant CENP-A, the epigenetic mark that identifies centromere position. Here, we interrogate the importance of CenDNA in centromere specification by developing a system to rapidly remove and reactivate CENP-A (CENP-A(OFF/ON) ). Using this system, we define the temporal cascade of events necessary to maintain centromere position. We unveil that CENP-B bound to CenDNA provides memory for maintenance on human centromeres by promoting de novo CENP-A deposition. Indeed, lack of CENP-B favors neocentromere formation under selective pressure. Occasionally, CENP-B triggers centromere re-activation initiated by CENP-C, but not CENP-A, recruitment at both ectopic and native centromeres. This is then sufficient to initiate the CENP-A-based epigenetic loop. Finally, we identify a population of CENP-A-negative, CENP-B/C-positive resting CD4(+) T cells capable to re-express and reassembles CENP-A upon cell cycle entry, demonstrating the physiological importance of the genetic memory.},

abstract = {Kinetochore specification and assembly requires the targeted deposition of specialized nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A at centromeres. However, CENP-A is not sufficient to drive full-kinetochore assembly, and it is not clear how centromeric chromatin is established. Here, we identify CENP-W as a component of the DNA-proximal constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) of proteins. We demonstrate that CENP-W forms a DNA-binding complex together with the CCAN component CENP-T. This complex directly associates with nucleosomal DNA and with canonical histone H3, but not with CENP-A, in centromeric regions. CENP-T/CENP-W functions upstream of other CCAN components with the exception of CENP-C, an additional putative DNA-binding protein. Our analysis indicates that CENP-T/CENP-W and CENP-C provide distinct pathways to connect the centromere with outer kinetochore assembly. In total, our results suggest that the CENP-T/CENP-W complex is directly involved in establishment of centromere chromatin structure coordinately with CENP-A. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {CENP-A incorporation is critical for centromere specification and is mediated by the chaperone HJURP. The CENP-A-targeting domain (CATD) of CENP-A specifically binds to HJURP, and this binding is conserved. However, the binding interface of CENP-A-HJURP is yet to be understood. Here, we identify the critical residues for chicken CENP-A or HJURP. The A59Q mutation in the $\alpha$1-helix of chicken CENP-A causes CENP-A mis-incorporation and subsequent cell death, whereas the corresponding mutation in human CENP-A does not. We also find that W53 of HJURP, which is a contact site of A59 in CENP-A, is also essential in chicken cells. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the affinities of HJURP to CATD differ between chickens and humans. However, the introduction of two arginine residues to the chicken HJURP $\alpha$A-helix suppresses CENP-A mis-incorporation in chicken cells expressing CENP-AA59Q. Our data explain the mechanisms and evolution of CENP-A essentiality by the CENP-A-HJURP interaction.},

abstract = {Nuf2 and Hec1 are evolutionarily conserved centromere proteins. To clarify the functions of these proteins in vertebrate cells, we characterized them in chicken DT40 cells. We generated GFP fusion constructs of Nuf2 and Hec1 to examine in detail the localization of these proteins during the cell cycle. We found that Nuf2 is associated with Hec1 throughout the cell cycle and that this complex is localized to the centrosomes during G1 and S phases and then moves through the nuclear membrane to the centromere in G2 phase. During mitosis, this complex is localized to the centromere. We also created conditional loss-of-function mutants of Nuf2 and Hec1. In both mutants, the cell cycle arrested at prometaphase, suggesting that the Nuf2-Hec1 complex is essential for mitotic progression. The inner centromere proteins CENP-A, -C, and -H and checkpoint protein BubR1 were localized to chromosomes in the mutant cells arrested at prometaphase, but Mad2 localization was abolished. Furthermore, photobleaching experiments revealed that the Nuf2-Hec1 complex is stably associated with the centromere and that interaction of this complex with the centrosome is dynamic.},

abstract = {Centromeres are specified by sequence-independent epigenetic mechanisms, and the centromere position may drift at each cell cycle, but once this position is specified, it may not be frequently moved. Currently, it is unclear whether the centromere position is stable. To address this question, we systematically analyzed the position of nonrepetitive centromeres in 21 independent clones isolated from a laboratory stock of chicken DT40 cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with massive parallel sequencing analysis with anti-CENP-A antibody. We demonstrated that the centromere position varies among the clones, suggesting that centromere drift occurs during cell proliferation. However, when we analyzed this position in the subclones obtained from one isolated clone, the position was found to be relatively stable. Interestingly, the centromere drift was shown to occur frequently in CENP-U-and CENP-S-deficient cells. Based on these results, we suggest that the centromere position can change after many cell divisions, but this drift is suppressed in short-term cultures, and the complete centromere structure contributes to the suppression of the centromere drift.},

abstract = {Centromeres are specified and maintained by sequence-independent epigenetic mechanisms through the incorporation of CENP-A into centromeres. Given that CENP-A incorporation requires the Mis18 complex to be in the centromere region, it is necessary to precisely understand how the Mis18 complex localizes to the centromere region. Here, we showed that centromere localization of the Mis18 complex depends on CENP-A, but not CENP-C or CENP-T, in chicken DT40 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that M18BP1/KNL2, a member of the Mis18 complex, contained the CENP-C-like motif in chicken and other vertebrates, which is essential for centromere localization and M18BP1/KNL2 function in DT40 cells. We also showed that in vitro reconstituted CENP-A nucleosome, but not H3 nucleosome, bound to the CENP-C-like motif containing M18BP1/KNL2. Based on these results, we conclude that M18BP1/KNL2 is essential for centromere formation through direct binding to CENP-A nucleosome in non-mammalian vertebrates. This explains how new CENP-A recognizes the centromere position. Centromeres are specified and maintained by the incorporation of the histone H3 variant CENP-A. Hori at al. provide insight into how new CENP-A recognizes the centromere position in non-mammalian vertebrates and demonstrate that the association of M18BP1/KNL2, a Mis18 complex component, with CENP-A nucleosome is essential for centromere formation.},

abstract = {CENP-A acts as an important epigenetic marker for kinetochore specification. However, the mechanisms by which CENP-A is incorporated into centromeres and the structural basis for kinetochore formation downstream of CENP-A remain unclear. Here, we used a unique chromosome-engineering system in which kinetochore proteins are targeted to a noncentromeric site after the endogenous centromere is conditionally removed. Using this system, we created two distinct types of engineered kinetochores, both of which were stably maintained in chicken DT40 cells. Ectopic targeting of full-length HJURP, CENP-C, CENP-I, or the CENP-C C terminus generated engineered kinetochores containing major kinetochore components, including CENP-A. In contrast, ectopic targeting of the CENP-T or CENP-C N terminus generated functional kinetochores that recruit the microtubule-binding Ndc80 complex and chromosome passenger complex (CPC), but lack CENP-A and most constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) proteins. Based on the analysis of these different engineered kinetochores, we conclude that the CCAN has two distinct roles: recruiting CENP-A to establish the kinetochore and serving as a structural core to directly recruit kinetochore proteins. {\textcopyright} 2013 Hori et al.},

abstract = {In vertebrate cells, centromeres are specified epigenetically through the deposition of the centromere-specific histone CENP-A. Following CENP-A deposition, additional proteins are assembled on centromeric chromatin. However, it remains unknown whether additional epigenetic features of centromeric chromatin are required for kinetochore assembly. Here, we used ChIP-seq analysis to examine centromere-specific histone modifications at chicken centromeres, which lack highly repetitive sequences. We found that H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) is enriched at centromeres. Immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses revealed that H4K20me1 is present at all centromeres inchicken and human cells. Based on immunoprecipitation data, H4K20me1 occurs primarily onthe histone H4 that is assembled as part oftheCENP-A nucleosome following depositionofCENP-A into centromeres. Targeting the H4K20me1-specific demethylase PHF8 to centromeres reduces the level of H4K20me1 at centromeres and results in kinetochore assembly defects.We conclude that H4K20me1 modification of CENP-A nucleosomes contributes to functional kinetochore assembly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Chromosomes must biorient on the mitotic spindle, with the two sisters attached to opposite spindle poles. The spindle checkpoint detects unattached chromosomes and monitors biorientation by detecting the lack of tension between two sisters attached to the same pole. After the spindle has been depolymerized and allowed to reform, budding yeast sgo1 mutants fail to biorient their sister chromatids and die as cells divide. Results: In sgo1 mutants, chromosomes attach to microtubules normally but cannot reorient if both sisters attach to the same pole. The mutants' fate depends on the position of the spindle poles when the chromosomes attach to microtubules. If the poles have separated, sister chromatids biorient, but if the poles are still close, sister chromatids often attach to the same pole, missegregate, and cause cell death. Conclusions: These observations argue that budding yeast mitotic chromosomes have an intrinsic, geometric bias to biorient on the spindle. When the poles have already separated, attaching one kinetochore to one pole predisposes its sister to attach to the opposite pole, allowing the cells to segregate the chromosomes correctly. When the poles have not separated, the second kinetochore eventually attaches to either of the two poles randomly, causing orientation errors that are corrected in the wild-type but not in sgo1 mutants. In the absence of spindle damage, sgo1 cells divide successfully, suggesting that kinetochores only make stable attachments to microtubules after the cells have entered mitosis and separated their spindle poles. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {During meiosis, the cohesin complexes that maintain sister chromatid cohesion are lost in a stepwise manner. At meiosis I the cohesin subunit Rec8 is cleaved only along the chromosome arms; until meiosis II it is protected at centromeres by the action of shugoshin (Sgo1)-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Although this regulation hypothetically involves phosphorylation that is antagonized by Sgo1-PP2A, the kinase and substrate that are responsible are as yet unknown. Using a genetic screen for 'anti-shugoshin', we identify Hhp2, an orthologue of casein kinase 1/(CK1), as a factor required for Rec8 cleavage in fission yeast. We show that CK1, rather than a Polo-like kinase that is widely believed to do so, acts as the cohesin kinase to promote this cleavage during meiosis. Crucially, forced localization of excess Hhp2 at the pericentromeric region abrogates the ability of Sgo1-PP2A to protect centromeric Rec8. Thus, our studies prove the key notion that the balance between Rec8 phosphorylation and its dephosphorylation by Sgo1-PP2A regulates the step-wise loss of chromosomal cohesion in meiosis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Iwaizumi2009,
abstract = {Background and aims: Chromosomal instability (CIN) is recognised as a hallmark of cancer and is caused by a spindle assembly checkpoint disorder or chromosome mis-segregation during mitosis. Although the recent identification of human shugoshin (hSgo1), an important player in proper chromosome segregation, has suggested the involvement of hSgo1 in colorectal tumourigenesis, little is known about how it is involved. The aim of this study was to obtain information about the status of hSgo1 in human colorectal cancer. Method and results: Among the 46 colorectal cancer cases, hSgo1 mRNA expression was decreased in the tumour tissue in comparison with the corresponding normal tissue (p = 0.032). Human Sgo1-downregulated tumours (tumour to normal mucosa ratio<0.5) had preferential location on the left side large bowel rather than on the right side (p = 0.012), and a higher variation of centromere numbers revealed by fluorescence in situhybridisation (FISH). To assess the effects of hSgo1 downregulation, hSgo1 knockdown was performed by transfecting the diploid HCT116 cell line with a short hairpin RNA expression vector. hSgo1 knockdown cells proliferated slowly because of both G2/M arrest and apoptosis (p<0.001), and markers of CIN in the form of aneuploidy (p<0.001) and micronuclei (p<0.005) were later observed in hSgo1 knockdown cells. Increased centrosome amplification (p<0.05), the presence of binucleated cells and mitotic catastrophes were also noted in hSgo1 knockdown cells. Conclusions: These findings suggest that hSgo1 -down-regulated colorectal cancers have a clinicopathological character of CIN, and hSgo1 downregulation leads to CIN in colorectal cancer cells.},

Centromeres and other repetitive sequences can drive in meiosis by cheating the segregation process [2], but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that centromeres with more satellite repeats house more nucleosomes that confer centromere identity, containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A, and bias their segregation to the egg relative to centromeres with fewer repeats. CENP-A nucleosomes predominantly occupy a single site within the repeating unit that becomes limiting for centromere assembly on smaller centromeres. We propose that amplified repetitive sequences act as selfish elements by promoting expansion of CENP-A chromatin and increased transmission through the female germline.},

Both phenomena could be based on a desensitization/oxidation of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Therefore, the present study aims at investigating the effects of the therapy with the sGC activator BAY 60-2770 and the sGC stimulator BAY 41-8543 on side effects induced by chronic nitroglycerin treatment. Male Wistar rats were treated with nitroglycerin (100. mg/kg/d for 3.5. days, s.c. in ethanol) and BAY 60-2770 (0.5 or 2.5. mg/kg/d) or BAY 41-8543 (1 and 5. mg/kg/d) for 6. days. Therapy with BAY 60-2770 but not with BAY 41-8543 improved nitroglycerin-triggered endothelial dysfunction and nitrate tolerance, corrected the decrease in aortic nitric oxide levels, improved the cGMP dependent activation of protein kinase I in aortic tissue and reduced vascular, cardiac and whole blood oxidative stress (fluorescence and chemiluminescence assays; 3-nitrotyrosine staining). In contrast to BAY 41-8543, the vasodilator potency of BAY 60-2770 was not impaired in isolated aortic ring segments from nitrate tolerant rats. sGC activator therapy improves partially the adverse effects of nitroglycerin therapy whereas sGC stimulation has only minor beneficial effects pointing to a nitroglycerin-dependent sGC oxidation/inactivation mechanism contributing to nitrate tolerance.},

abstract = {Centromeres direct chromosomal inheritance by nucleating assembly of the kinetochore, a large multiprotein complex required for microtubule attachment during mitosis. Centromere identity in humans is epigenetically determined, with no DNA sequence either necessary or sufficient. A prime candidate for the epigenetic mark is assembly into centromeric chromatin of centromere protein A (CENP-A), a histone H3 variant found only at functional centromeres. A new covalent fluorescent pulse-chase labeling approach using SNAP tagging has now been developed and is used to demonstrate that CENP-A bound to a mature centromere is quantitatively and equally partitioned to sister centromeres generated during S phase, thereby remaining stably associated through multiple cell divisions. Loading of nascent CENP-A on the megabase domains of replicated centromere DNA is shown to require passage through mitosis but not microtubule attachment. Very surprisingly, assembly and stabilization of new CENP-A-containing nucleosomes is restricted exclusively to the subsequent G1 phase, demonstrating direct coupling between progression through mitosis and assembly/maturation of the next generation of centromeres. {\textcopyright} The Rockefeller University Press.},

The SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) RING-finger protein 4 (RNF4) and RNF111 recognize SUMO polymers in a chain-architecture-dependent manner, leading to the formation of hybrid chains, which could enable proteasomal destruction of proteins. Recent publications have highlighted essential roles for SUMO chain disassembly by the mammalian SUMO proteases SENP6 and SENP7 and the yeast SUMO protease Ulp2. SENP6 is particularly important for centromere assembly. These recent findings demonstrate the diversity of SUMO polymer signal transduction for proteolytic and nonproteolytic purposes.},

abstract = {The attachment of sister kinetochores by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles establishes chromosome bipolar attachment, which generates tension on chromosomes and is essential for sister-chromatid segregation. Syntelic attachment occurs when both sister kinetochores are attached by microtubules from the same spindle pole and this attachment is unable to generate tension on chromosomes, but a reliable method to induce syntelic attachments is not available in budding yeast. The spindle checkpoint can sense the lack of tension on chromosomes as well as detached kinetochores to prevent anaphase onset. In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, tension checkpoint proteins Aurora/Ipl1 kinase and centromere-localized Sgo1 are required to sense the absence of tension but are dispensable for the checkpoint response to detached kinetochores. We have found that the loss of function of a motor protein complex Cik1/Kar3 in budding yeast leads to syntelic attachments. Inactivation of either the spindle or tension checkpoint enables premature anaphase entry in cells with dysfunctional Cik1/Kar3, resulting in co-segregation of sister chromatids. Moreover, the abolished Kar3-kinetochore interaction in cik1 mutants suggests that the Cik1/Kar3 complex mediates chromosome movement along microtubules, which could facilitate bipolar attachment. Therefore, we can induce syntelic attachments in budding yeast by inactivating the Cik1/Kar3 complex, and this approach will be very useful to study the checkpoint response to syntelic attachments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Jin et al.},

abstract = {Mitosis is the most conspicuous cell cycle phase, because it is the phase in which the dynamic physical distributions of cellular components into the two daughter cells occur. The separation of sister chromatids is especially important during mitosis, because of the extreme accuracy required for distribution to the next generation of cells. Shugoshin-like 1 (SGOL1) is a key protein in protecting sister chromatids from precocious separation. We have reported finding that chromosome instability is more likely in SGOL1-downregulated colorectal cancers, but it is still unknown whether there is an association between cancer and SGOL1 transcript variation. Here, we identified a novel SGOL1 variant, SGOL1-P1, in human colon cancer. The SGOL1-P1 transcript contains an exon-skip of exon 3 that results in a stop codon occurring within exon 4. Overexpression of SGOL1-P1 in HCT116 cells resulted in an increased number of cells with aberrant chromosome alignment, precociously separated chromatids and delayed mitotic progression, occasionally followed by inaccurate distribution of the chromosomes. These phenotypes, observed when SGOL1-P1 was present, were also observed very frequently in SGOL1-knockdown cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of SGOL1-P1 inhibited the localization of endogenous SGOL1 and cohesin subunit RAD21/SCC1 to the centromere. These results suggest that SGOL1-P1 may function as a negative factor to native SGOL1, and that abundant expression of SGOL1-P1 may be responsible for chromosomal instability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) has been proposed to protect centromeric sister-chromatid cohesion by directly targeting Sgo1 to centromeres in mitosis. Here we show that HP1a is targeted to mitotic centromeres by INCENP, a subunit of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC). Biochemical and structural studies show that both HP1-INCENP and HP1-Sgo1 interactions require the binding of the HP1 chromo shadow domain to PXVXL/I motifs in INCENP or Sgo1, suggesting that the INCENP-bound, centromeric HP1a is incapable of recruiting Sgo1. Consistently, a Sgo1 mutant deficient in HP1 binding is functional in centromeric cohesion protection and localizes normally to centromeres in mitosis. By contrast, INCENP or Sgo1 mutants deficient in HP1 binding fail to localize to centromeres in interphase. Therefore, our results suggest that HP1 binding by INCENP or Sgo1 is dispensable for centromeric cohesion protection during mitosis of human cells, but might regulate yet uncharacterized interphase functions of CPC or Sgo1 at the centromeres. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Here we show that Sgo1 is degraded during the exit from mitosis, and its degradation depends on the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Overexpression of Cdh1 reduces the protein levels of ectopically expressed Sgo1 in human cells. Sgo1 is ubiquitinated by APC/C bound to Cdh1 (APC/C Cdh1) in vitro. We have further identified two functional degradation motifs in Sgo1; that is, a KEN (Lys-Glu-Asn) box and a destruction box (D box). Although removal of either motif is not sufficient to stabilize Sgo1, Sgo1 with both KEN box and D box deleted is stable in cells. Surprisingly, mitosis progresses normally in the presence of non-degradable Sgo1, indicating that degradation of Sgo1 is not required for sister-chromatid separation or mitotic exit. Finally, we show that the spindle checkpoint kinase Bub1 contributes to the maintenance of Sgo1 steady-state protein levels in an APC/C- independent mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: The halving of chromosome number that occurs during meiosis depends on three factors. First, homologs must pair and recombine. Second, sister centromeres must attach to microtubules that emanate from the same spindle pole, which ensures that homologous maternal and paternal pairs can be pulled in opposite directions (called homolog biorientation). Third, cohesion between sister centromeres must persist after the first meiotic division to enable their biorientation at the second. Results: A screen performed in fission yeast to identify meiotic chromosome missegregation mutants has identified a conserved protein called Sgo1 that is required to maintain sister chromatid cohesion after the first meiotic division. We describe here an orthologous protein in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (Sc), which has not only meiotic but also mitotic chromosome segregation functions. Deletion of Sc SGO1 not only causes frequent homolog nondisjunction at meiosis I but also random segregation of sister centromeres at meiosis II. Meiotic cohesion fails to persist at centromeres after the first meiotic division, and sister centromeres frequently separate precociously. Sgo1 is a kinetochore-associated protein whose abundance declines at anaphase I but, nevertheless, persists on chromatin until anaphase II. Conclusions: The finding that Sgo1 is localized to the centromere at the time of the first division suggests that it may play a direct role in preventing the removal of centromeric cohesin. The similarity in sequence composition, chromosomal location, and mutant phenotypes of sgo1 mutants in two distant yeasts with that of MEI-S332 in Drosophila suggests that these proteins define an orthologous family conserved in most eukaryotic lineages.},

abstract = {Fission yeast shugoshin Sgo1 is meiosis specific and cooperates with protein phosphatase 2A to protect centromeric cohesin at meiosis I. The other shugoshin-like protein Sgo2, which requires the heterochromatin protein Swi6/HP1 for full viability, plays a crucial role for proper chromosome segregation at both mitosis and meiosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are totally elusive. We here demonstrate that, unlike Sgo1, Sgo2 is dispensable for centromeric protection of cohesin. Instead, Sgo2 interacts with Bir1/Survivin and promotes Aurora kinase complex localization to the pericentromeric region, to correct erroneous attachment of kinetochores and thereby enable tension-generating attachment. Forced localization of Bir1 to centromeres partly restored the defects of sgo2$\Delta$. This newly identified interaction of shugoshin with Survivin is conserved between mitosis and meiosis and presumably across eukaryotes. We propose that ensuring bipolar attachment of kinetochores is the primary role of shugoshin and the role of cohesion protection might have codeveloped to facilitate this process. {\textcopyright} 2007 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

The h2a-SA mutant, in which all cellular H2A-S121 is replaced by alanine, phenocopies the bubl kinase-dead mutant (jaubl-KD) in losing the centromeric localization of shugoshin proteins. Artificial tethering of shugoshin to centromeres largely restores the h2a-SA or bubl-KD-n[ate{\'{a}} CIN defects, a function that is evolutionally conserved.

During meiosis this protein regulates the removal of cohesins, the proteins that hold sister chromatids together, from chromosomes. During mitosis, Sgo1 is required for sensing the absence of tension caused by sister kinetochores not being attached to microtubules emanating from opposite poles. Here we describe a differential requirement for Sgo1 in the segregation of homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids. Sgo1 plays only a minor role in segregating homologous chromosomes at meiosis I. In contrast, Sgo1 is important to bias sister kinetochores toward biorientation. We suggest that Sgo1 acts at sister kinetochores to promote their biorientation. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract = {The stepwise loss of cohesins, the complexes that hold sister chromatids together, is required for faithful meiotic chromosome segregation. Cohesins are removed from chromosome arms during meiosis I but are maintained around centromeres until meiosis II. Here we show that Sgo1, a protein required for protecting centromeric cohesins from removal during meiosis I, localizes to cohesin-associated regions (CARs) at the centromere and the 50-kb region surrounding it. Establishment of this Sgo1-binding domain requires the 120-base-pair (bp) core centromere, the kinetochore component Bub1, and the meiosis-specific factor Spo13. Interestingly, cohesins and the kinetochore proteins Iml3 and Chl4 are necessary for Sgo1 to associate with pericentric regions but less so for Sgo1 to associate with the core centromeric regions. Finally, we show that the 50-kb Sgo1-binding domain is the chromosomal region where cohesins are protected from removal during meiosis I. Our results identify the portions of chromosomes where cohesins are protected from removal during meiosis I and show that kinetochore components and cohesins themselves are required to establish this cohesin protective domain. {\textcopyright} 2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {The kinetochore is the crucial apparatus regulating chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. Particularly in meiosis I, unlike in mitosis, sister kinetochores are captured by microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole (mono-orientation) and centromeric cohesion mediated by cohesin is protected in the following anaphase. Although meiotic kinetochore factors have been identified only in budding and fission yeasts, these molecules and their functions are thought to have diverged earlier. Therefore, a conserved mechanism for meiotic kinetochore regulation remains elusive. Here we have identified in mouse a meiosis-specific kinetochore factor that we termed MEIKIN, which functions in meiosis I but not in meiosis II or mitosis. MEIKIN plays a crucial role in both mono-orientation and centromeric cohesion protection, partly by stabilizing the localization of the cohesin protector shugoshin. These functions are mediated mainly by the activity of Polo-like kinase PLK1, which is enriched to kinetochores in a MEIKIN-dependent manner. Our integrative analysis indicates that the long-awaited key regulator of meiotic kinetochore function is Meikin, which is conserved from yeasts to humans.},

abstract = {Shugoshin (Sgo) proteins constitute a conserved protein family defined as centromeric protectors of Rec8-containing cohesin complexes in meiosis [1-4]. In vertebrate mitosis, Scc1/Rad21-containing cohesin complexes are also protected at centromeres because arm cohesin, but not centromeric cohesin, is largely dissociated in pro- and prometaphase [5, 6]. The dissociation process is dependent on the activity of polo-like kinase (Plk1) and partly dependent on Aurora B [7-9]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that vertebrate shugoshin is required for preserving centromeric cohesion during mitosis [10]; however, it was not addressed whether human shugoshin protects cohesin itself. Here, we show that the persistence of human Scc1 at centromeres in mitosis is indeed dependent on human Sgo1. In fission yeast, Sgo localization depends on Bub1, a conserved spindle checkpoint protein, which is enigmatically also required for chromosome congression during prometaphase in vertebrate cells. We demonstrate that human Sgo1 fails to localize at centromeres in Bub1-repressed cells, and centromeric cohesion is significantly loosened. Remarkably, in these cells, Sgo1 relocates to chromosomes all along their length and provokes ectopic protection from dissociation of Scc1 on chromosome arms. These results reveal a hitherto concealed role for human Bub1 in defining the persistent cohesion site of mitotic chromosomes.},

In animal mitotic cells, phosphorylation of cohesin promotes its dissociation from chromosomes, but centromeric cohesin is protected by shugoshin until kinetochores are properly captured by the spindle microtubules. However, the mechanism of shugoshin-dependent protection of cohesin is unknown. Here we find a specific subtype of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) associating with human shugoshin. PP2A colocalizes with shugoshin at centromeres and is required for centromeric protection. Purified shugoshin complex has an ability to reverse the phosphorylation of cohesin in vitro, suggesting that dephosphorylation of cohesin is the mechanism of protection at centromeres. Meiotic shugoshin of fission yeast also associates with PP2A, with both proteins collaboratively protecting Rec8-containing cohesin at centromeres. Thus, we have revealed a conserved mechanism of centromeric protection of eukaryotic chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic chromosome segregation relies upon specific connections from DNA to the microtubule-based spindle that forms at cell division. The chromosomal locus that directs this process is the centromere, where a structure called the kinetochore forms upon entry into mitosis. Recent crystallography and single-particle electron microscopy have provided unprecedented high-resolution views of the molecular complexes involved in this process. The centromere is epigenetically specified by nucleosomes harbouring a histone H3 variant, CENP-A, and we review recent progress on how it differentiates centromeric chromatin from the rest of the chromosome, the biochemical pathway that mediates its assembly and how two non-histone components of the centromere specifically recognize CENP-A nucleosomes. The core centromeric nucleosome complex (CCNC) is required to recruit a 16-subunit complex termed the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN), and we highlight recent structures reported of the budding yeast CCAN. Finally, the structures of multiple modular sub-complexes of the kinetochore have been solved at near-atomic resolution, providing insight into how connections are made to the CCAN on one end and to the spindle microtubules on the other. One can now build molecular models from the DNA through to the physical connections to microtubules.},

abstract = {During cell division, kinetochores form the primary chromosomal attachment sites for spindle microtubules. We previously identified a network of 10 interacting kinetochore proteins conserved between Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. In this study, we investigate three proteins in the human network (hDsn1Q9H410, hNnf1PMF1, and hNsl1DC31). Using coexpression in bacteria and fractionation of mitotic extracts, we demonstrate that these proteins form a stable complex with the conserved kinetochore component hMis12. Human or chicken cells depleted of Mis12 complex subunits are delayed in mitosis with misaligned chromosomes and defects in chromosome biorientation. Aligned chromosomes exhibited reduced centromere stretch and diminished kinetochore microtubule bundles. Consistent with this, localization of the outer plate constituent Ndc80HEC1 was severely reduced. The checkpoint protein BubR1, the fibrous corona component centromere protein (CENP) E, and the inner kinetochore proteins CENP-A and CENP-H also failed to accumulate to wild-type levels in depleted cells. These results indicate that a four-subunit Mis12 complex plays an essential role in chromosome segregation in vertebrates and contributes to mitotic kinetochore assembly. {\textcopyright} The Rockefeller University Press.},

abstract = {During mitosis, chromatin condensation shapes chromosomes as separate, rigid, and compact sister chromatids to facilitate their segregation. Here, we show that, unlike wild-type yeast chromosomes, non-chromosomal DNA circles and chromosomes lacking a centromere fail to condense during mitosis. The centromere promotes chromosome condensation strictly in cis through recruiting the kinases Aurora B and Bub1, which trigger the autonomous condensation of the entire chromosome. Shugoshin and the deacetylase Hst2 facilitated spreading the condensation signal to the chromosome arms. Targeting Aurora B to DNA circles or centromere-ablated chromosomes or releasing Shugoshin from PP2A-dependent inhibition bypassed the centromere requirement for condensation and enhanced the mitotic stability of DNA circles. Our data indicate that yeast cells license the chromosome-autonomous condensation of their chromatin in a centromere-dependent manner, excluding from this process non-centromeric DNA and thereby inhibiting their propagation. Yeast centromeres propagate a cis-acting chromosome condensation signal.},

abstract = {The segregation of eukaryotic chromosomes during mitosis requires their extensive folding into units of manageable size for the mitotic spindle. Here, we report on how phosphorylation at serine 10 of histone H3 (H3 S10) contributes to this process. Using a fluorescence-based assay to study local compaction of the chromatin fiber in living yeast cells, we show that chromosome condensation entails two temporally and mechanistically distinct processes. Initially, nucleosome-nucleosome interaction triggered by H3 S10 phosphorylation and deacetylation of histone H4 promote short-range compaction of chromatin during early anaphase. Independently, condensin mediates the axial contraction of chromosome arms, a process peaking later in anaphase. Whereas defects in chromatin compaction have no observable effect on axial contraction and condensin inactivation does not affect short-range chromatin compaction, inactivation of both pathways causes synergistic defects in chromosome segregation and cell viability. Furthermore, both pathways rely at least partially on the deacetylase Hst2, suggesting that this protein helps coordinating chromatin compaction and axial contraction to properly shape mitotic chromosomes.},

abstract = {Background: The centromere is a specialized chromosomal locus that forms the basis for the assembly of a multi-protein complex, the kinetochore and ensures faithful chromosome segregation during every cell division. The repetitive nature of the underlying centromeric sequence represents a major obstacle for high-resolution mapping of protein binding using methods that rely on annotated genomes. Here, we present a novel microscopy-based approach called "APEX-chromatin fibers" for localizing protein binding over the repetitive centromeric sequences at kilobase resolution. Results: By fusing centromere factors of interest to ascorbate peroxidase, we were able to label their binding profiles on extended chromatin fibers with biotin marks. We applied APEX-chromatin fibers to at least one member of each CCAN complex, most of which show a localization pattern different from CENP-A but within the CENP-A delineated centromeric domain. Interestingly, we describe here a novel characteristic of CENP-I and CENP-B that display extended localization beyond the CENP-A boundaries. Conclusions: Our approach was successfully applied for mapping protein association over centromeric chromatin, revealing previously undescribed localization patterns. In this study, we focused on centromeric factors, but we believe that this approach could be useful for mapping protein binding patterns in other repetitive regions.},

abstract = {Chromatin remodelers regulate the nucleosome barrier during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. The chromatin remodeler RSF1 is enriched at mitotic centromeres, but the functional consequences of this enrichment are not completely understood. Shugoshin (Sgo1) protects centromeric cohesion during mitosis and requires BuB1-dependent histone H2A phosphorylation (H2A-pT120) for localization. Loss of Sgo1 at centromeres causes chromosome missegregation. Here, we show that RSF1 regulates Sgo1 localization to centromeres through coordinating a crosstalk between histone acetylation and phosphorylation. RSF1 interacts with and recruits HDAC1 to centromeres, where it counteracts TIP60-mediated acetylation of H2A at K118. This deacetylation is required for the accumulation of H2A-pT120 and Sgo1 deposition, as H2A-K118 acetylation suppresses H2A-T120 phosphorylation by Bub1. Centromeric tethering of HDAC1 prevents premature chromatid separation in RSF1 knockout cells. Our results indicate that RSF1 regulates the dynamics of H2A histone modifications at mitotic centromeres and contributes to the maintenance of chromosome stability.},

abstract = {Reductional chromosome segregation in germ cells, where sister chromatids are pulled to the same pole, accompanies the protection of cohesin at centromeres from separase cleavage. Here, we show that mammalian shugoshin Sgo2 is expressed in germ cells and is solely responsible for the centromeric localization of PP2A and the protection of cohesin Rec8 in oocytes, proving conservation of the mechanism from yeast to mammals. However, this role of Sgo2 contrasts with its mitotic role in protecting centromeric cohesin only from prophase dissociation, but never from anaphase cleavage. We demonstrate that, in somatic cells, shugoshin colocalizes with cohesin in prophase or prometaphase, but their localizations become separate when centromeres are pulled oppositely at metaphase. Remarkably, if tension is artificially removed from the centromeres at the metaphase-anaphase transition, cohesin at the centromeres can be protected from separase cleavage even in somatic cells, as in germ cells. These results argue for a unified view of centromeric protection by shugoshin in mitosis and meiosis.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors During mitosis, sister chromatids attach to microtubules which generate $\sim$ 700 pN pulling force focused on the centromere. We report that chromatin-localized signals generated by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) maintain the integrity of the kinetochore and centromere against this force. Without sufficient Plk1 activity, chromosomes become misaligned after normal condensation and congression. These chromosomes are silent to the mitotic checkpoint, and many lag and mis-segregate in anaphase. Their centromeres and kinetochores lack CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-T, Hec1, Nuf2, and Knl1; however, CENP-B is retained. CENP-A loss occurs coincident with secondary misalignment and anaphase onset. This disruption occurs asymmetrically prior to anaphase and requires tension generated by microtubules. Mechanistically, centromeres highly recruit PICH DNA helicase and PICH depletion restores kinetochore disruption in pre-anaphase cells. Furthermore, anaphase defects are significantly reduced by tethering Plk1 to chromatin, including H2B, and INCENP, but not to CENP-A. Taken as a whole, this demonstrates that Plk1 signals are crucial for stabilizing centromeric architecture against tension.},

abstract = {Centromeres are specified epigenetically in animal cells. Therefore, faithful chromosome inheritance requires accurate maintenance of epigenetic centromere marks during progression through the cell cycle. Clarification of the mechanisms that control centromere protein behavior during the cell cycle should profit from the relatively simple protein composition of Drosophila centromeres. Thus we have analyzed the dynamics of the three key players Cid/Cenp-A, Cenp-C and Cal1 in S2R+ cells using quantitative microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, in combination with novel fluorescent cell cycle markers. As revealed by the observed protein abundances and mobilities, centromeres proceed through at least five distinct states during the cell cycle, distinguished in part by unexpected Cid behavior. In addition to the predominant Cid loading onto centromeres during G1, a considerable but transient increase was detected during early mitosis. A low level of Cid loading was detected in late S and G2, starting at the reported time of centromere DNA replication. Our results reveal the complexities of Drosophila centromere protein dynamics and its intricate coordination with cell cycle progression. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {In contrast to our extensive knowledge on ubiquitin polymer signaling, we are severely limited in our understanding of poly-SUMO signaling. We set out to identify substrates conjugated to SUMO polymers, using knockdown of the poly-SUMO2/3 protease SENP6. We identify over 180 SENP6 regulated proteins that represent highly interconnected functional groups of proteins including the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), the CENP-A loading factors Mis18BP1 and Mis18A and DNA damage response factors. Our results indicate a striking protein group de-modification by SENP6. SENP6 deficient cells are severely compromised for proliferation, accumulate in G2/M and frequently form micronuclei. Accumulation of CENP-T, CENP-W and CENP-A to centromeres is impaired in the absence of SENP6. Surprisingly, the increase of SUMO chains does not lead to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of the CCAN subunits. Our results indicate that SUMO polymers can act in a proteolysis-independent manner and consequently, have a more diverse signaling function than previously expected.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation requires coordination between the dissolution of sister-chromatid cohesion and the establishment of proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment [1-6]. During mitosis, sister-chromatid cohesion at centromeres enables the biorientation of and tension across sister kinetochores. The complex between shugoshin and protein phosphatase 2A (Sgo1-PP2A) localizes to centromeres in mitosis [7-10], binds to cohesin in a reaction requiring Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of Sgo1 [11], dephosphorylates cohesin-bound sororin [11], and protects a centromeric pool of cohesin from mitotic kinases and the cohesin inhibitor Wapl [11-14]. Cleavage of centromeric cohesin by separase allows sister chromatids connected to microtubules from opposing poles to be evenly partitioned into daughter cells [15, 16]. The centromeric localization of Sgo1 requires histone H2A phosphorylation at T120 (H2A-pT120) by the kinase Bub1 [17-19]. The exact role of H2A-pT120 in Sgo1 regulation is, however, unclear. Here, we show that cohesin and H2A-pT120 specify two distinct pools of Sgo1-P2A at inner centromeres and kinetochores, respectively, in human cells. Bub1 inactivation delocalizes cohesin-Sgo1 to chromosome arms. Kinetochore tension triggers Sgo1 dephosphorylation and redistributes Sgo1 from inner centromeres to kinetochores. Incomplete Sgo1 redistribution causes chromosome nondisjunction. Our study suggests that Bub1-mediated H2A phosphorylation penetrates kinetochores and that this histone mark contributes to a tension-sensitive Sgo1-based molecular switch for chromosome segregation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Human sister chromatids at metaphase are primarily linked by centromeric cohesion, forming the iconic Xshape. Premature loss of centromeric cohesion disrupts orderly mitotic progression. Shugoshin (Sgo1) binds to and protects cohesin at inner centromeres. The kinetochore kinase Bub1 phosphorylates histone H2A at T120 (H2A-pT120) and recruits Sgo1 to kinetochores, 0.5$\mu$m from inner centromeres. Here, we show that Sgo1 is a direct reader of the H2A-pT120 mark. Bub1 also recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to unattached kinetochores and promotes active transcription at mitotic kinetochores. Mitosis-specific inactivation of Pol II traps Sgo1 at kinetochores and weakens centromeric cohesion. Sgo1 interacts with Pol II in human cells and with RNA invitro. We propose that Pol II-dependent transcription enables kinetochore-bound Sgo1 initially recruited by H2A-pT120 to reach cohesin embedded in centromeric chromatin. Our study implicates mitotic transcription in targeting regulatory factors to highly compacted mitotic chromatin.},

abstract = {Timely dissolution of sister-chromatid cohesion in mitosis ensures accurate chromosome segregation to guard against aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. The complex of shugoshin and protein phosphatase 2A (SGO1-PP2A) protects cohesin at centromeres from premature removal by mitotic kinases and WAPL in prophase. Here we address the regulation and mechanism of human SGO1 in centromeric cohesion protection, and show that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-mediated, mitosis-specific phosphorylation of SGO1 activates its cohesion-protection function and enables its direct binding to cohesin. The phospho-SGO1-bound cohesin complex contains PP2A, PDS5 and hypophosphorylated sororin, but lacks WAPL. Expression of non-phosphorylatable sororin bypasses the requirement for SGO1-PP2A in centromeric cohesion. Thus, mitotic phosphorylation of SGO1 targets SGO1-PP2A to cohesin, promotes dephosphorylation of PDS5-bound sororin and protects centromeric cohesin from WAPL. PP2A-orchestrated, site-selective dephosphorylation of cohesin and its regulators underlies centromeric cohesion protection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Although the sequence determinants of human CENP-A required to maintain a centromere were reported, those that are required for early steps in establishing a new centromere are unknown. In this paper, we used gain-of-function histone H3 chimeras containing various regions unique to CENP-A to investigate early events in centromere establishment. We targeted histone H3 chimeras to chromosomally integrated Lac operator sequences by fusing each of the chimeras to the Lac repressor. Using this approach, we found surprising contributions from a small portion of the N-terminal tail and the CENP-A targeting domain in the initial recruitment of two essential constitutive centromere proteins, CENP-C and CENP-T. Our results indicate that the regions of CENP-A required for early events in centromere establishment differ from those that are required for maintaining centromere identity.},

abstract = {To ensure genome stability during cell division, all chromosomes must attach to spindles emanating from the opposite spindle pole bodies before segregation. The tension between sister chromatids generated by the poleward pulling force is an integral part of chromosome biorientation. In budding yeast, the residue Gly44 of histone H3 is critical for retaining the conserved Shugoshin protein Sgo1p at the pericentromeres for monitoring the tension status during mitosis. Studies carried out in this work showed that Lys42, Gly44, and Thr45 of H3 form the core of a tension sensing motif (TSM). Similar to the previously reported G44S mutant, K42A, G44A, and T45A alleles all rendered cells unable to respond to erroneous spindle attachment, a phenotype suppressed by Sgo1p overexpression. TSM functions by physically recruiting or retaining Sgo1p at pericentromeres as evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation and by in vitro pulldown experiments. Intriguingly, the function of TSM is likely regulated by multiple histone modifying enzymes, including the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5p, and deacetylases Rpd3p and Hos2p. Defects caused by TSM mutations can be suppressed by the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of Gcn5p. Conversely, G44S mutant cells exhibit prominent chromatin instability phenotype in the absence of RPD3. Importantly, the gcn5¯ suppressor restores the tension sensing function in tsm¯ background in a fashion that bypasses the need of stably associating Sgo1p with chromatin. These results demonstrate that the TSM of histone H3 is a key component of a mechanism that ensures faithful segregation, and that interaction with chromatin modifying enzymes may be an important part of the mitotic quality control process.},

abstract = {Chromosome missegregation into a micronucleus can cause complex and localized genomic rearrangements known as chromothripsis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. Here we developed an inducible Y centromere-selective inactivation strategy by exploiting a CENP-A/histone H3 chimaera to directly examine the fate of missegregated chromosomes in otherwise diploid human cells. Using this approach, we identified a temporal cascade of events that are initiated following centromere inactivation involving chromosome missegregation, fragmentation, and re-ligation that span three consecutive cell cycles. Following centromere inactivation, a micronucleus harbouring the Y chromosome is formed in the first cell cycle. Chromosome shattering, producing up to 53 dispersed fragments from a single chromosome, is triggered by premature micronuclear condensation prior to or during mitotic entry of the second cycle. Lastly, canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but not homology-dependent repair, is shown to facilitate re-ligation of chromosomal fragments in the third cycle. Thus, initial errors in cell division can provoke further genomic instability through fragmentation of micronuclear DNAs coupled to NHEJ-mediated reassembly in the subsequent interphase.},

abstract = {Since it was first identified in Drosophila as a centromeric protein, MEI-S332/Shugoshin (Sgo1) has been an enigma. It is neither a kinase nor a phosphatase, but Sgo1's many functions are often attributable to protein-protein interactions that require Sgo1's presence to localize and/or function properly in a timely manner. Though much has been reported about Sgo1's role in ensuring proper genome segregation through its regulatory role in maintaining cohesion through protection of centromeric cohesin, several additional functions have been identified that are less well characterized. In higher eukaryotes Sgo2 and a splice variant of Sgo1 make up a small family of shugoshin proteins, whereas in budding yeast a single Sgo1 exists, and available data suggest that the many functions carried out by Sgo2 and the splice variant are handled exclusively by the Sgo1 homolog in yeast. In fact, the function of the mammalian splice variant is the factor that has revealed a new possible role for shugoshin in centrosome regulation, which may be related mechanistically to its task in protection of centromeric cohesin. New evidence in budding yeast supports this line of reasoning, which may represent an exciting new advance in exposing the myriad faces of the guardian spirit. {\textcopyright}2009 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {The shugoshin/Mei-S332 family are proteins that associate with the chromosomal region surrounding the centromere (the pericentromere) and that play multiple and distinct roles in ensuring the accuracy of chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis. The underlying role of shugoshins appears to be to serve as pericentromeric adaptor proteins that recruit several different effectors to this region of the chromosome to regulate processes critical for chromosome segregation. Crucially, shugoshins undergo changes in their localization in response to the tension that is exerted on sister chromosomes by the forces of the spindle that will pull them apart. This has led to the idea that shugoshins provide a platform for activities required at the pericentromere only when sister chromosomes lack tension. Conversely, disassembly of the shugoshin pericentromeric platform may provide a signal that sister chromosomes are under tension. Here the functions and regulation of these important tension-sensitive pericentromeric proteins are discussed.},

Consistent with this role, Sgo1 localizes to centromeric regions but dissociates at the onset of anaphase II.

abstract = {Most eukaryotic centromeres are located within heterochromatic regions. Paradoxically, heterochromatin can also antagonize de novo centromere formation, and some centromeres lack it altogether. In order to investigate the importance of heterochromatin at centromeres, we used epigenetic engineering of a synthetic alphoidtetO human artificial chromosome (HAC), to which chimeric proteins can be targeted. By tethering the JMJD2D demethylase (also known as KDM4D), we removed heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 (histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation) specifically from the HAC centromere. This caused no short-term defects, but long-term tethering reduced HAC centromere protein levels and triggered HAC mis-segregation. However, centromeric CENP-A was maintained at a reduced level. Furthermore, HAC centromere function was compatible with an alternative lowH3K9me3, high-H3K27me3 chromatin signature, as long as residual levels of H3K9me3 remained. When JMJD2D was released from the HAC, H3K9me3 levels recovered over several days back to initial levels along with CENP-A and CENP-C centromere levels, and mitotic segregation fidelity. Our results suggest that a minimal level of heterochromatin is required to stabilize mitotic centromere function but not for maintaining centromere epigenetic memory, and that a homeostatic pathway maintains heterochromatin at centromeres.},

We studied the role of SGOL1 and its splice variants in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using 82 frozen NSCLC tissue samples. SGOL1-B expression was prevalent in smokers, in cases with a wild-type (WT) EGFR status, and in cases with the focal copy number amplification of genes that are known to be important for defining the biological behaviors of NSCLC. The overexpression of SGOL1-B1 in an NSCLC cell line induced aberrant chromosome missegregation, precociously separated chromatids, and delayed mitotic progression. A higher level of SGOL1-B mRNA was related to taxane resistance, while the forced downregulation of SGOL1-B increased the sensitivity to taxane. These results suggest that the expression of SGOL1-B causes abnormal mitosis and taxane resistance in NSCLC cells.},

abstract = {During mitosis, the macromolecular kinetochore complex assembles on the centromere to orchestrate chromosome segregation. The properties and architecture of the 16-subunit Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) that allow it to build a robust platform for kinetochore assembly are poorly understood. Here, we use inducible CRISPR knockouts and biochemical reconstitutions to define the interactions between the human CCAN proteins. We find that the CCAN does not assemble as a linear hierarchy, and instead, each sub-complex requires multiple non-redundant interactions for its localization to centromeres and the structural integrity of the overall assembly. We demonstrate that the CENP-L-N complex plays a crucial role at the core of this assembly through interactions with CENP-C and CENP-H-I-K-M. Finally, we show that the CCAN is remodeled over the cell cycle such that sub-complexes depend on their interactions differentially. Thus, an interdependent meshwork within the CCAN underlies the centromere specificity and stability of the kinetochore.},

abstract = {Centromeres are microtubule attachment sites on chromosomes defined by the enrichment of histone variant CENP-A-containing nucleosomes. To preserve centromere identity, CENP-A must be escorted to centromeres by a CENP-A-specific chaperone for depo- sition. Despite this essential requirement, many eukaryotes differ in the composition of players involved in centromere maintenance, highlighting the plasticity of this process. In humans, CENP-A recognition and centromere targeting are achieved by HJURP and the Mis18 complex, respectively. Using X-ray crystallography, we here show how Drosophila CAL1, an evolutionarily distinct CENP-A histone chaperone, binds both CENP-A and the centromere recep- tor CENP-C without the requirement for the Mis18 complex. While an N-terminal CAL1 fragment wraps around CENP-A/H4 through multiple physical contacts, a C-terminal CAL1 fragment directly binds a CENP-C cupin domain dimer. Although divergent at the primary structure level, CAL1 thus binds CENP-A/H4 using evolu- tionarily conserved and adaptive structural principles. The CAL1 binding site on CENP-C is strategically positioned near the cupin dimerisation interface, restricting binding to just one CAL1 mole- cule per CENP-C dimer. Overall, by demonstrating how CAL1 binds CENP-A/H4 and CENP-C, we provide key insights into the minimal- istic principles underlying centromere maintenance},

abstract = {CENH3 is a centromere-specific histone H3 variant essential for kinetochore assembly. Despite its central role in centromere function, there has been no conclusive evidence supporting CENH3 as sufficient to determine centromere identity. To address this question, we artificially targeted Drosophila CENH3 (CENP-A/CID) as a CID-GFP-LacI fusion protein to stably integrated lac operator (lacO) arrays. This ectopic CID focus assembles a functional kinetochore and directs incorporation of CID molecules without the LacI-anchor, providing evidence for the self-propagation of the epigenetic mark. CID-GFP-LacI-bound extrachromosomal lacO plasmids can assemble kinetochore proteins and bind microtubules, resulting in their stable transmission for several cell generations even after eliminating CID-GFP-LacI. We conclude that CID is both necessary and sufficient to serve as an epigenetic centromere mark and nucleate heritable centromere function.},

abstract = {CENP-H is a constitutive centromere component that localizes to the centromere throughout the cell cycle. Because CENP-H is colocalized with CENP-A and CENP-C, it is thought to be an inner centromere protein. We previously generated a conditional loss-of-function mutant of CENP-H and showed that CENP-H is required for targeting of CENP-C to the centromere in chicken DT40 cells. In the present study, we used this mutant to identify the functional region of chicken CENP-H necessary for centromere targeting and cell viability. This region was found by yeast two-hybrid analysis to interact with Hec1, which is a member of the Nuf2 complex that transiently localizes to the centromere during mitosis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CENP-H interacts with the Nuf2 complex in chicken DT40 cells. Photobleaching experiments showed that both Hec1 and CENP-H form stable associations with the centromeres during mitosis, suggesting that Hec1 acts as a structural component of centromeres during mitosis. On the basis of these results and previously published data, we propose that the Nuf2 complex functions as a connector between the inner and outer kinetochores.},

abstract = {Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are central to development as they are the precursors of all cell types in the embryo. Therefore, maintaining a stable karyotype is essential, both for their physiological role as well as for their use in regenerative medicine. Karyotype abnormalities in PSCs in culture are common but the underlying causes remain unknown. To gain insight, we explore the composition of the centromere and kinetochore in human embryonic and induced PSCs. Centromere function depends on CENP-A nucleosome-defined chromatin. We show that while PSCs maintain abundant pools of CENP-A, CENP-C and CENP-T, these essential centromere components are strongly reduced at stem cell centromeres. Outer kinetochore recruitment is also impaired to a lesser extent, indicating an overall weaker kinetochore while the inner centromere protein Aurora B remains unaffected. We further show that, similar to differentiated human cells, CENP-A chromatin assembly in PSCs requires transition into G1 phase. Finally, reprogramming experiments indicate that reduction of centromeric CENP-A levels is an early event during dedifferentiation, coinciding with global chromatin remodelling. Our characterization of centromeres in human stem cells suggests a possible link between impaired centromere function and stem cell aneuploidies.},

We found that CENP-50 is a constitutive component of the centromere that colocalizes with CENP-A and CENP-H throughout the cell cycle in vertebrate cells. To determine the precise role of CENP-50, we examined its role in centromere function by generating a loss-of-function mutant in the chicken DT40 cell line. The CENP-50 knockout was not lethal; however, the growth rate of cells with this mutation was slower than that of wild-type cells. We observed that the time for CENP-50-deficient cells to complete mitosis was longer than that for wild-type cells. Centromeric localization of CENP-50 was abolished in both CENP-H- and CENP-I-deficient cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CENP-50 interacted with the CENP-H/CENP-I complex in chicken DT40 cells. We also observed severe mitotic defects in CENP-50-deficient cells with apparent premature sister chromatid separation when the mitotic checkpoint was activated, indicating that CENP-50 is required for recovery from spindle damage.},

abstract = {Centromeres are defined by a self-propagating chromatin structure based on stable inheritance of CENP-A containing nucleosomes. Here, we present a genetic screen coupled to pulse-chase labeling that allow us to identify proteins selectively involved in deposition of nascent CENP-A or in long-term transmission of chromatin-bound CENP-A. These include factors with known roles in DNA replication, repair, chromatin modification, and transcription, revealing a broad set of chromatin regulators that impact on CENP-A dynamics. We further identify the SUMO-protease SENP6 as a key factor, not only controlling CENP-A stability but virtually the entire centromere and kinetochore. Loss of SENP6 results in hyper-SUMOylation of CENP-C and CENP-I but not CENP-A itself. SENP6 activity is required throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that a dynamic SUMO cycle underlies a continuous surveillance of the centromere complex that in turn ensures stable transmission of CENP-A chromatin.},

abstract = {Chromosome segregation during cell division is driven by mitotic spindle attachment to the centromere region on each chromosome. Centromeres form a protein scaffold defined by chromatin featuring CENP-A, a conserved histone H3 variant, in a manner largely independent of local DNA cis elements. CENP-A nucleosomes fulfill two essential criteria to epigenetically identify the centromere. They undergo self-templated duplication to reestablish centromeric chromatin following DNA replication. More importantly, CENP-A incorporated into centromeric chromatin is stably transmitted through consecutive cell division cycles. CENP-A nucleosomes have unique structural properties and binding partners that potentially explain their long lifetime in vivo. However, rather than a static building block, centromeric chromatin is dynamically regulated throughout the cell cycle, indicating that CENP-A stability is also controlled by external factors. We discuss recent insights and identify the outstanding questions on how dynamic control of the long-term stability of CENP-A ensures epigenetic centromere inheritance.},

abstract = {Background: Histone variants alter the composition of nucleosomes and play crucial roles in transcription, chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and sperm compaction. Modification of metazoan histone variant lineages occurs on a background of genome architecture that shows global similarities from sponges to vertebrates, but the urochordate, Oikopleura dioica, a member of the sister group to vertebrates, exhibits profound modification of this ancestral architecture. Results: We show that a histone complement of 47 gene loci encodes 31 histone variants, grouped in distinct sets of developmental expression profiles throughout the life cycle. A particularly diverse array of 15 male-specific histone variants was uncovered, including a testes-specific H4t, the first metazoan H4 sequence variant reported. Universal histone variants H3.3, CenH3, and H2A.Z are present but O. dioica lacks homologs of macroH2A and H2AX. The genome encodes many H2A and H2B variants and the repertoire of H2A.Z isoforms is expanded through alternative splicing, incrementally regulating the number of acetylatable lysine residues in the functionally important N-terminal "charge patch". Mass spectrometry identified 40 acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and showed that hallmark PTMs of "active" and "repressive" chromatin were present in O. dioica. No obvious reduction in silent heterochromatic marks was observed despite high gene density in this extraordinarily compacted chordate genome. Conclusions: These results show that histone gene complements and their organization differ considerably even over modest phylogenetic distances. Substantial innovation among all core and linker histone variants has evolved in concert with adaptation of specific life history traits in this rapidly evolving chordate lineage. {\textcopyright} 2011Moosmann et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2. 0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

abstract = {The duplication and segregation of the genome during cell division is crucial to maintain cell identity, development of organisms and tissue maintenance. Centromeres are at the basis of accurate chromosome segregation as they define the site of assembly of the kinetochore, a large complex of proteins that attaches to spindle microtubules driving chromosome movement during cell division. Here we summarize nearly 40 years of research focussed on centromere specification and the role of local cis elements in creating a stable centromere. Initial discoveries in budding yeast in the 1980s opened up the field and revealed essential DNA sequence elements that define centromere position and function. Further work in humans discovered a centromeric DNA sequence-specific binding protein and centromeric $\alpha$-satellite DNA was found to have the capacity to seed centromeres de novo. Despite the early indication of genetic elements as drivers of centromere specification, the discovery in the nineties of neocentromeres that form on unrelated DNA sequences, shifted the focus to epigenetic mechanisms. While specific sequence elements appeared non-essential, the histone H3 variant CENP-A was identified as a crucial component in centromere specification. Neocentromeres, occurring naturally or induced experimentally, have become an insightful tool to understand the mechanisms for centromere specification and will be the focus of this review. They have helped to define the strong epigenetic chromatin-based component underlying centromere inheritance but also provide new opportunities to understand the enigmatic, yet crucial role that DNA sequence elements play in centromere function and inheritance.},

Long-read sequencing revealed this neocentromere was formed by purely epigenetic means and assembly of a functional kinetochore correlated with CENP-A seeding, eviction of H3K9me3 and local accumulation of mitotic cohesin and RNA polymerase II. At formation, the young neocentromere showed markedly reduced chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) occupancy and poor sister chromatin cohesion. However, long-term tracking revealed increased CPC assembly and low-level transcription providing evidence for centromere maturation over time.},

abstract = {The kinetochore is a crucial structure for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis and is formed in the centromeric region of each chromosome. The 16-subunit protein complex known as the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) forms the foundation for kinetochore assembly on the centromeric chromatin. Although the CCAN can be divided into several subcomplexes, it remains unclear how CCAN proteins are organized to form the functional kinetochore. In particular, this organization may vary as the cell cycle progresses. To address this, we analyzed the relationship of centromeric protein (CENP)-C with the CENP-H complex during progression of the cell cycle. We find that the middle portion of chicken CENP-C (CENP-C166-324) is sufficient for centromere localization during interphase, potentially through association with the CENP-L-N complex. The C-terminus of CENPC (CENP-C601-864) is essential for centromere localization during mitosis, through binding to CENP-A nucleosomes, independent of the CENP-H complex. On the basis of these results, we propose that CCAN organization changes dynamically during progression of the cell cycle.},

This complex region has a distinct type of chromatin in which histone H3 is replaced by a structurally different homologue identified in humans as CENP-A. In metazoans, specific DNA sequences are neither required nor sufficient for centromere identity. Rather, an epigenetic mark comprised of CENP-A containing chromatin is thought to be the major determinant of centromere identity. In this view, CENP-A deposition and chromatin assembly are fundamental processes for the maintenance of centromeric identity across mitotic and meiotic divisions. Several lines of evidence support CENP-A deposition in metazoans occurring at only one time in the cell cycle. Such cell cycle-dependent loading of CENP-A is found in divergent species from human to fission yeast, albeit with differences in the cell cycle point at which CENP-A is assembled. Cell cycle dependent CENP-A deposition requires multiple assembly factors for its deposition and maintenance. This review discusses the regulation of new CENP-A deposition and its relevance to centromere identity and inheritance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Chromatin assembled with centromere protein A (CENP-A) is the epigenetic mark of centromere identity. Using new reference models, we now identify sites of CENP-A and histone H3.1 binding within the megabase, $\alpha$-satellite repeat-containing centromeres of 23 human chromosomes. The overwhelming majority (97%) of $\alpha$-satellite DNA is found to be assembled with histone H3.1-containing nucleosomes with wrapped DNA termini. In both G1 and G2 cell cycle phases, the 2-4% of $\alpha$-satellite assembled with CENP-A protects DNA lengths centered on 133 bp, consistent with octameric nucleosomes with DNA unwrapping at entry and exit. CENP-A chromatin is shown to contain equimolar amounts of CENP-A and histones H2A, H2B, and H4, with no H3. Solid-state nanopore analyses show it to be nucleosomal in size. Thus, in contrast to models for hemisomes that briefly transition to octameric nucleosomes at specific cell cycle points or heterotypic nucleosomes containing both CENP-A and histone H3, human CENP-A chromatin complexes are octameric nucleosomes with two molecules of CENP-A at all cell cycle phases.},

abstract = {Chromatin assembled with the histone H3 variant CENP-A is the heritable epigenetic determinant of human centromere identity. Using genome-wide mapping and reference models for 23 human centromeres, CENP-A binding sites are identified within the megabase-long, repetitive $\alpha$-satellite DNAs at each centromere. CENP-A is shown in early G1 to be assembled into nucleosomes within each centromere and onto 11,390 transcriptionally active sites on the chromosome arms. DNA replication is demonstrated to remove ectopically loaded, non-centromeric CENP-A. In contrast, tethering of centromeric CENP-A to the sites of DNA replication through the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) is shown to enable precise reloading of centromere-bound CENP-A onto the same DNA sequences as in its initial prereplication loading. Thus, DNA replication acts as an error correction mechanism for maintaining centromere identity through its removal of non-centromeric CENP-A coupled with CCAN-mediated retention and precise reloading of centromeric CENP-A.},

abstract = {During mitosis and meiosis, sister chromatid cohesion resists the pulling forces of microtubules, enabling the generation of tension at kinetochores upon chromosome biorientation. How tension is read to signal the bioriented state remains unclear. Shugoshins form a pericentromeric platform that integrates multiple functions to ensure proper chromosome biorientation. Here we show that budding yeast shugoshin Sgo1 dissociates from the pericentromere reversibly in response to tension. The antagonistic activities of the kinetochore-associated Bub1 kinase and the Sgo1-bound phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-Rts1 underlie a tension-dependent circuitry that enables Sgo1 removal upon sister kinetochore biorientation. Sgo1 dissociation from the pericentromere triggers dissociation of condensin and Aurora B from the centromere, thereby stabilizing the bioriented state. Conversely, forcing sister kinetochores to be under tension during meiosis I leads to premature Sgo1 removal and precocious loss of pericentromeric cohesion. Overall, we show that the pivotal role of shugoshin is to build a platform at the pericentromere that attracts activities that respond to the absence of tension between sister kinetochores. Disassembly of this platform in response to intersister kinetochore tension signals the bioriented state. Therefore, tension sensing by shugoshin is a central mechanism by which the bioriented state is read. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nerusheva et al.},

To determine the precise function of CENP-I, we examined its role in centromere function by generating a conditional loss-of-function mutant in the chicken DT40 cell line. In the absence of CENP-I, cells arrested at prometaphase with misaligned chromosomes for long periods of time. Eventually, cells exited mitosis without undergoing cytokinesis. Immunocytochemical analysis of CENP-I-deficient cells demonstrated that both CENP-I and CENP-H are necessary for localization of CENP-C but not CENP-A to the centromere.},

abstract = {Outstanding questions in the chromatin field bear on how large heterochromatin domains are formed in space and time. Positive feedback, where histone-modifying enzymes are attracted to chromosomal regions displaying the modification they catalyse, is believed to drive the formation of these domains; however, few quantitative studies are available to assess this hypothesis. Here we quantified the de novo establishment of a naturally occurring ∼20-kb heterochromatin domain in fission yeast through single-cell analyses, measuring the kinetics of heterochromatin nucleation in a region targeted by RNAi and its subsequent expansion. We found that nucleation of heterochromatin is stochastic and can take from one to ten cell generations. Further silencing of the full region takes another one to ten generations. Quantitative modelling of the observed kinetics emphasizes the importance of local feedback, where a nucleosome-bound enzyme modifies adjacent nucleosomes, combined with a feedback where recruited enzymes can act at a distance.},

However, the precise mechanisms that target CENP-A to centromeres remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated a multi-subunit complex, which includes the established inner kinetochore components CENP-H and CENP-I, and nine other proteins, from both human and chicken cells. Our analysis of these proteins demonstrates that the CENP-H–I complex can be divided into three functional sub-complexes, each of which is required for faithful chromosome segregation. Interestingly, newly expressed CENP-A is not efficiently incorporated into centromeres in knockout mutants of a subclass of CENP-H–I complex proteins, indicating that the CENP-H–I complex may function, in part, as a marker directing CENP-A deposition to centromeres. {\textcopyright} 2006, Nature Publishing Group Ltd.

The centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A plays a central role in specifying the locus where the centromere is constructed. However, the precise mechanisms that target CENP-A to centromeric chromatin are poorly understood. Here, we show that facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) localizes to centromeres in a CENP-H-containing complex-dependent manner. In conditional mutant cell lines for SSRP1, a subunit of FACT, centromere targeting of newly synthesized CENP-A is severely inhibited. The chromatin remodeling factor CHD1 binds to SSRP1 both in vivo and in vitro and associates with centromeres. The centromeric localization of CHD1 is lost in SSRP1-depleted cells. RNA interference knockdown of CHD1 leads to a decrease in the amount of centromere localized CENP-A. These findings indicate that the CENP-H-containing complex facilitates deposition of newly synthesized CENP-A into centromeric chromatin in cooperation with FACT and CHD1. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Cell Biology.},

abstract = {The centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENH3 (also known as CENP-A) is considered to be an epigenetic mark for establishment and propagation of centromere identity. Pulse induction of CENH3 (Drosophila CID) in Schneider S2 cells leads to its incorporation into non-centromeric regions and generates CID islands that resist clearing from chromosome arms for multiple cell generations. We demonstrate that CID islands represent functional ectopic kinetochores, which are non-randomly distributed on the chromosome and show a preferential localization near telomeres and pericentric heterochromatin in transcriptionally silent, intergenic chromatin domains. Although overexpression of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) or increasing histone acetylation interferes with CID island formation on a global scale, induction of a locally defined region of synthetic heterochromatin by targeting HP1-LacI fusions to stably integrated Lac operator arrays produces a proximal hotspot for CID deposition. These data indicate that the characteristics of regions bordering heterochromatin promote de novo kinetochore assembly and thereby contribute to centromere identity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

At the level of quaternary structure and assembly, we find that CENP-A arrays are composed of octameric nucleosomes that assemble in a stepwise mechanism, recapitulating conventional array assembly with canonical histones. At intermediate structural resolution, we find that CENP-A-containing arrays are globally condensed relative to arrays with the canonical histones. At high structural resolution, using hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS), we find that the DNA superhelical termini within each nucleosome are loosely connected to CENP-A, and we identify the key amino acid substitution that is largely responsible for this behavior. Also the C terminus of histone H2A undergoes rapid hydrogen exchange relative to canonical arrays and does so in a manner that is independent of nucleosomal array folding. These findings have implications for understanding CENP-A-containing nucleosome structure and higher-order chromatin folding at the centromere.},

abstract = {Correct chromosome segregation is essential in order to prevent aneuploidy. To segregate sister chromatids equally to daughter cells, the sisters must attach to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. This so-called biorientation manifests itself by increased tension and conformational changes across kinetochores and pericentric chromatin. Tensionless attachments are dissolved by the activity of the conserved mitotic kinase Aurora B/Ipl1, thereby promoting the formation of correctly attached chromosomes. Recruitment of the conserved centromeric protein shugoshin is essential for biorientation, but its exact role has been enigmatic. Here, we identify a novel function of shugoshin (Sgo1 in budding yeast) that together with the protein phosphatase PP2A-Rts1 ensures localization of condensin to the centromeric chromatin in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Failure to recruit condensin results in an abnormal conformation of the pericentric region and impairs the correction of tensionless chromosome attachments. Moreover, we found that shugoshin is required for maintaining Aurora B/Ipl1 localization on kinetochores during metaphase. Thus, shugoshin has a dual function in promoting biorientation in budding yeast: first, by its ability to facilitate condensin recruitment it modulates the conformation of the pericentric chromatin. Second, shugoshin contributes to the maintenance of Aurora B/Ipl1 at the kinetochore during gradual establishment of bipolarity in budding yeast mitosis. Our findings identify shugoshin as a versatile molecular adaptor that governs chromosome biorientation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Peplowska et al.},

abstract = {Equal distribution of DNA in mitosis requires the assembly of a large proteinaceous ensemble onto the centromeric DNA, called the kinetochore. With few exceptions, kinetochore specification is independent of the DNA sequence and is determined epigenetically by deposition at the centromeric chromatin of special nucleosomes containing an H3-related histone, CENP-A. Onto centromeric CENP-A chromatin is assembled the so-called constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) of 16 proteins distributed in several functional groups as follows: CENP-C, CENP-H/CENP-I/CENP-K/, CENP-L/CENP-M/CENP-N, CENP-O/CENP-P/CENP-Q/CENP-R/CENP-U(50), CENP-T/CENP-W, and CENP-S/CENP-X. One role of the CCAN is to recruit outer kinetochore components further, such as KNL1, the Mis12 complex, and the Ndc80 complex (KMN network) to which attach the spindle microtubules with their structural and regulatory proteins. Among the CENPs in CCAN, CENP-C and CENP-T are required in parallel for operational kinetochore specification and spindle attachment. This review presents discussion of the latest structural and functional data on CENP-A and CENPs from the CCAN as well as their interaction with the KMN network. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP mediates CENP-A deposition at centromeres. The N-terminal region of HJURP is responsible for binding to soluble CENP-A. However, it is unclear whether other regions of HJURP have additional functions for centromere formation and maintenance. In this study, we generated chicken DT40 knockout cell lines and gene replacement constructs for HJURP to assess the additional functions of HJURP in vivo. Our analysis revealed that the middle region of HJURP associates with the Mis18 complex protein M18BP1/KNL2 and that the HJURP-M18BP1 association is required for HJURP function. In addition, on the basis of the analysis of artificial centromeres induced by ectopic HJURP localization, we demonstrate that HJURP exhibits a centromere expansion activity that is separable from its CENP-A-binding activity. We also observed centromere expansion surrounding natural centromeres after HJURP overexpression. We propose that this centromere expansion activity reflects the functional properties of HJURP, which uses this activity to contribute to the plastic establishment of a centromeric chromatin structure.},

abstract = {Stochastic processes govern the time evolution of a huge variety of realistic systems throughout the sciences. A minimal description of noisy many-particle systems within a Markovian picture and with a notion of spatial dimension is given by probabilistic cellular automata, which typically feature time-independent and short-ranged update rules. Here, we propose a simple cellular automaton with power-law interactions that gives rise to a bistable phase of long-ranged directed percolation whose long-time behaviour is not only dictated by the system dynamics, but also by the initial conditions. In the presence of a periodic modulation of the update rules, we find that the system responds with a period larger than that of the modulation for an exponentially (in system size) long time. This breaking of discrete time translation symmetry of the underlying dynamics is enabled by a self-correcting mechanism of the long-ranged interactions which compensates noise-induced imperfections. Our work thus provides a firm example of a classical discrete time crystal phase of matter and paves the way for the study of novel non-equilibrium phases in the unexplored field of driven probabilistic cellular automata.},

IgG3 represents ∼8% of the total amount of IgG in human serum and stands out from the other IgG subclasses because of its elongated hinge region and enhanced effector functions. This study reports partial O-glycosylation of the IgG3 hinge region, observed with nanoLC-ESI-IT-MS(/MS) analysis after proteolytic digestion. The repeat regions within the IgG3 hinge were found to be in part O-glycosylated at the threonine in the triple repeat motif. Non-, mono- and disialylated core 1-type O-glycans were detected in various IgG3 samples, both poly- and monoclonal. NanoLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS with electron transfer dissociation fragmentation and CE-MS/MS with CID fragmentation were used to determine the site of IgG3 O-glycosylation. The O-glycosylation site was further confirmed by the recombinant production of mutant IgG3 in which potential O-glycosylation sites had been knocked out. For IgG3 samples from six donors we found similar O-glycan structures and site occupancies, whereas for the same samples the conserved N-glycosylation of the Fc CH2 domain showed considerable interindividual variation. The occupancy of each of the three O-glycosylation sites was found to be ∼10% in six serum-derived IgG3 samples and ∼13% in two monoclonal IgG3 allotypes.},

abstract = {In Drosophila melanogaster, as in many animal and plant species, centromere identity is specified epigenetically. In proliferating cells, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CenH3), named Cid in Drosophila and Cenp-A in humans, is a crucial component of the epigenetic centromere mark. Hence, maintenance of the amount and chromosomal location of CenH3 during mitotic proliferation is important. Interestingly, CenH3 may have different roles during meiosis and the onset of embryogenesis. In gametes of Caenorhabditis elegans, and possibly in plants, centromere marking is independent of CenH3. Moreover, male gamete differentiation in animals often includes global nucleosome for protamine exchange that potentially could remove CenH3 nucleosomes. Here we demonstrate that the control of Cid loading during male meiosis is distinct from the regulation observed during the mitotic cycles of early embryogenesis. But Cid is present in mature sperm. After strong Cid depletion in sperm, paternal centromeres fail to integrate into the gonomeric spindle of the first mitosis, resulting in gynogenetic haploid embryos. Furthermore, after moderate depletion, paternal centromeres are unable to re-acquire normal Cid levels in the next generation. We conclude that Cid in sperm is an essential component of the epigenetic centromere mark on paternal chromosomes and it exerts quantitative control over centromeric Cid levels throughout development. Hence, the amount of Cid that is loaded during each cell cycle appears to be determined primarily by the preexisting centromeric Cid, with little flexibility for compensation of accidental losses. {\textcopyright} 2012 Raychaudhuri et al.},

abstract = {Centromere protein A (CENP-A) is a centromere-specific histone H3 variant conserved amongst all eukaryotes. We have isolated the chicken gene for CENP-A (GgCENP-A). It encodes a 131-amino-acid polypeptide that possesses an average identity of 54% with human CENP-A, reaching 69% in the histone-fold domain. The gene spans 1.7 kb of genomic DNA and contains four exons that range in size from 78 to 186 bp. The exon/intron organisation of the chicken gene is conserved with its mammalian counterparts in the carboxy-terminal histone-fold domain (exons 2 to 4), consistent with the strong conservation of this domain at the amino acid level. Sequence analysis of the chicken CENP-A locus revealed that the gene is located within the class III genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and extended the previously defined limit of the compact chicken MHC complex. We compared the sequences of CENP-A from mammals, chicken and fishes and thereby identified conserved motifs in the otherwise variable amino-terminal tail that may be important for functional reasons. We also identified evolutionarily variable regions within the conserved histone-fold domain. We found that loop 1 between the first and second $\alpha$-helix is the region that diverged most widely. This finding is in agreement with evolutionary studies in Drosophila species, and suggests that this domain could play a role in species-specific centromere targeting of CENP-A. In addition, protein sequence comparison of several vertebrate species revealed that the RT-PCR strategy we have developed for isolating the chicken centromeric histone H3 variant gene should be applicable to the isolation of CENP-A from a wide range of vertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we have analyzed the consequences of disrupting the CENP-A gene in the chicken DT40 cell line. In CENP-A-depleted cells, kinetochore protein assembly is impaired, as indicated by mislocalization of the inner kinetochore proteins CENP-I, CENP-H, and CENP-C as well as the outer components Nuf2/Hec1, Mad2, and CENP-E. However, BubR1 and the inner centromere protein INCENP are efficiently recruited to kinetochores. Following CENP-A depletion, chromosomes are deficient in proper congression on the mitotic spindle and there is a transient delay in prometaphase. CENP-A-depleted cells further proceed through anaphase and cytokinesis with unequal chromosome segregation, suggesting that some kinetochore function remains following substantial depletion of CENP-A. We furthermore demonstrate that CENP-A-depleted cells exhibit a specific defect in maintaining kinetochore localization of the checkpoint protein BubR1 under conditions of checkpoint activation. Our data thus point to a specific role for CENP-A in assembly of kinetochores competent in the maintenance of mitotic checkpoint signaling.},

abstract = {A longstanding question in centromere biology has been the organization of CENP-A-containing chromatin and its implications for kinetochore assembly. Here, we have combined genetic manipulations with deconvolution and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy for a detailed structural analysis of chicken kinetochores. Using fluorescence microscopy with subdiffraction spatial resolution and single molecule sensitivity to map protein localization in kinetochore chromatin unfolded by exposure to a low salt buffer, we observed robust amounts of H3K9me3, but only low levels of H3K4me2, between CENP-A subdomains in unfolded interphase prekinetochores. Constitutive centromere-associated network proteins CENP-C and CENP-H localize within CENP-A-rich subdomains (presumably on H3-containing nucleosomes) whereas CENP-T localizes in interspersed H3-rich blocks. Although interphase prekinetochores are relatively more resistant to unfolding than surrounding pericentromeric heterochromatin, mitotic kinetochores are significantly more stable, reflecting mitotic kinetochore maturation. Loss of CENP-H, CENP-N, or CENP-W had little or no effect on the unfolding of mitotic kinetochores. However, loss of CENP-C caused mitotic kinetochores to unfold to the same extent as their interphase counterparts. Based on our results we propose a new model for inner centromeric chromatin architecture in which chromatin is folded as a layered boustrophedon, with planar sinusoids containing interspersed CENP-A-rich and H3-rich subdomains oriented toward the outer kinetochore.

abstract = {Segregation of homologous maternal and paternal centromeres to opposite poles during meiosis I depends on post-replicative crossing over between homologous non-sister chromatids, which creates chiasmata and therefore bivalent chromosomes. Destruction of sister chromatid cohesion along chromosome arms due to proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Rec8 subunit by separase resolves chiasmata and thereby triggers the first meiotic division. This produces univalent chromosomes, the chromatids of which are held together by centromeric cohesin that has been protected from separase by shugoshin (Sgo1/MEI-S332) proteins. Here we show in both fission and budding yeast that Sgo1 recruits to centromeres a specific form of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Its inactivation causes loss of centromeric cohesin at anaphase I and random segregation of sister centromeres at the second meiotic division. Artificial recruitment of PP2A to chromosome arms prevents Rec8 phosphorylation and hinders resolution of chiasmata. Our data are consistent with the notion that efficient cleavage of Rec8 requires phosphorylation of cohesin and that this is blocked by PP2A at meiosis I centromeres. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

Most eukaryotic centromeres are defined epigenetically by the histone H3 variant, centromere protein (CENP)-A, yet how its self-propagation is achieved remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a heterologous system to reconstitute epigenetic inheritance of centromeric chromatin by ectopically targeting the Drosophila centromere proteins dCENP-A, dCENP-C, and CAL1 to LacO arrays in human cells. Dissecting the function of these three components uncovers the key role of self-association of dCENP-C and CAL1 for their mutual interaction and dCENP-A deposition. Importantly, we identify CAL1 to be required for dCENP-C loading onto chromatin in cooperation with dCENP-A nucleosomes, thus closing the epigenetic loop to ensure dCENP-C and dCENP-A replenishment during the cell division cycle. Finally, we show that all three factors are sufficient for dCENP-A propagation and propose a model for the epigenetic inheritance of Drosophila centromere identity.},

abstract = {During meiosis, a single round of genome duplication is followed by two sequential rounds of chromosome segregation. Through this process, a diploid parent cell generates gametes with a haploid set of chromosomes. A characteristic of meiotic chromosome segregation is a stepwise loss of sister chromatid cohesion along chromosomal arms and at centromeres. Whereas arm cohesion plays an important role in ensuring homologue disjunction at meiosis I, persisting cohesion at pericentromeric regions throughout meiosis I is essential for the faithful equational segregation of sisters in the following meiosis II, similar to mitosis. A widely conserved pericentromeric protein called shugoshin, which associates with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), plays a critical role in this protection of cohesin. Another key aspect of meiosis I is the establishment of monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores to spindle microtubules. Cohesion or physical linkage at the core centromeres, where kinetochores assemble, may conjoin sister kinetochores, leading to monopolar attachment. A meiosis-specific kinetochore factor such as fission yeast Moa1 or budding yeast monopolin contributes to this regulation. We propose that cohesion at the core centromere and pericentromeric regions plays distinct roles, especially in defining the orientation of kinetochores. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Condensins I and II in vertebrates are essential ATP-dependent complexes necessary for chromosome condensation in mitosis. Condensins depletion is known to perturb structure and function of centromeres, however the mechanism of this functional link remains elusive. Depletion of condensin activity is now shown to result in a significant loss of loading of CENP-A, the histone H3 variant found at active centromeres and the proposed epigenetic mark of centromere identity. Absence of condensins and/or CENP-A insufficiency produced a specific kinetochore defect, such that a functional mitotic checkpoint cannot prevent chromosome missegregation resulting from improper attachment of sister kinetochores to spindle microtubules. Spindle microtubule-dependent deformation of both inner kinetochores and the HEC1/Ndc80 microtubule-capturing module, then results in kinetochore separation from the Aurora B pool and ensuing reduced kinase activity at centromeres. Moreover, recovery from mitosis-inhibition by monastrol revealed a high incidence of merotelic attachment that was nearly identical with condensin depletion, Aurora B inactivation, or both, indicating that the Aurora B dysfunction is the key defect leading to chromosome missegregation in condensin-depleted cells. Thus, beyond a requirement for global chromosome condensation, condensins play a pivotal role in centromere assembly, proper spatial positioning of microtubule-capturing modules and positioning complexes of the inner centromere versus kinetochore plates.},

abstract = {Centromeres are unique chromosomal domains that control chromosome segregation, and are epigenetically specified by the presence of the CENP-A containing nucleosomes. CENP-A governs centromere function by recruiting the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) complex. The features of the CENP-A nucleosome necessary to distinguish centromeric chromatin from general chromatin are not completely understood. Here we show that CENP-A undergoes $\alpha$-amino trimethylation by the enzyme NRMT in vivo. We show that $\alpha$-amino trimethylation of the CENP-A tail contributes to cell survival. Loss of $\alpha$-amino trimethylation causes a reduction in the CENP-T and CENP-I CCAN components at the centromere and leads to lagging chromosomes and spindle pole defects. The function of p53 alters the response of cells to defects associated with decreased CENP-A methylation. Altogether we show an important functional role for $\alpha$-amino trimethylation of the CENP-A nucleosome in maintaining centromere function and faithful chromosomes segregation.},

abstract = {Cebranopadol is a novel, first-in-class analgesic with agonist activity at the nociceptin/orphanin FQ opioid peptide (NOP) receptor as well as the classical opioid peptide receptors. This study investigated the anti-hypersensitive effect of cebranopadol in a rat model of arthritic pain. Selective antagonists were used to probe the involvement of the NOP receptor and the µ-opioid peptide (MOP) receptors. Experimental mono-arthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of complete Freund's adjuvant into the left hind knee joint. Intravenous (i.v.) administration of cebranopadol 0.8–8.0 µg/kg to rats 5 days after induction of arthritis elicited dose-dependent increases in weight bearing on the affected limb. The quarter-maximal effective dose (ED25) for this anti-hypersensitive effect of cebranopadol was 1.6 µg/kg i.v. (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8, 1.6). The ED25 increased to 3.2 µg/kg i.v. (95% CI: 2.4, 4.0) following pretreatment with the selective NOP receptor antagonist J-113397 and to 18.3 µg/kg i.v. (95% CI: 9.6, 146.0) following pretreatment with the MOP receptor antagonist naloxone (at intraperitoneal antagonist doses of 4.64 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively). The MOP receptor agonist morphine and the NOP receptor agonist Ro65–6570 also elicited increases in weight bearing on the affected limb. The anti-hypersensitive effect of morphine 2.15 mg/kg i.v. was inhibited by naloxone but not by J-113397. Conversely, the anti-hypersensitive effect of Ro65–6570 0.464 mg/kg i.v. was inhibited by J-113397 but not by naloxone. In conclusion, cebranopadol evoked potent anti-hypersensitive efficacy in a rat model of arthritic pain, and this involved agonist activity at both the NOP and MOP receptors.},

Cenp-A/Cid is required for the recruitment of Cenp-C, another conserved centromere protein. With yeast three-hybrid experiments, we demonstrate that the essential Drosophila centromere protein Cal1 can link Cenp-A/Cid and Cenp-C. Cenp-A/Cid and Cenp-C interact with the N- and C-terminal domains of Cal1, respectively. These Cal1 domains are sufficient for centromere localization and function, but only when linked together. Using quantitative in vivo imaging to determine protein copy numbers at centromeres and kinetochores, we demonstrate that centromeric Cal1 levels are far lower than those of Cenp-A/Cid, Cenp-C and other conserved kinetochore components, which scale well with the number of kinetochore microtubules when comparing Drosophila with budding yeast. Rather than providing a stoichiometric link within the mitotic kinetochore, Cal1 limits centromeric deposition of Cenp-A/Cid and Cenp-C during exit from mitosis. We demonstrate that the low amount of endogenous Cal1 prevents centromere expansion and mitotic kinetochore failure when Cenp-A/Cid and Cenp-C are present in excess.},

abstract = {The kinetochore is assembled during mitotic and meiotic divisions within the centromeric region of chromosomes. It is composed of more than eighty different proteins. Spc105 (also designated as Spc7, KNL-1 or Blinkin in different eukaryotes) is a comparatively large kinetochore protein, which can bind to the Mis12/MIND and Ndc80 complexes and to the spindle assembly checkpoint components Bub1 and BubR1. Our genetic characterization of Drosophila Spc105 shows that a truncated version lacking the rapidly evolving, repetitive central third still provides all essential functions. Moreover, in comparison with Cenp-C that has previously been observed to extend from the inner to the outer kinetochore region, full-length Spc105 is positioned further out and is not similarly extended along the spindle axis. Thus, our results indicate that Spc105 forms neither an extended link connecting inner Cenp-A chromatin with outer kinetochore regions nor a scaffold constraining kinetochore subcomplexes and spindle assembly checkpoint components together into a geometrically rigid supercomplex. Spc105 seems to provide a platform within the outer kinetochore allowing independent assembly of various kinetochore components. {\textcopyright} 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

abstract = {Chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis depends on the assembly of functional kinetochores within centromeric regions. Centromeric DNA and kinetochore proteins show surprisingly little sequence conservation despite their fundamental biological role. However, our identification in Drosophila melanogaster of the most diverged orthologs identified so far, which encode components of a kinetochore protein network including the Ndc80 and Mis complexes, further emphasizes the notion of a shared eukaryotic kinetochore design. To determine its spatial organization, we have analyzed by quantitative light microscopy hundreds of native chromosomes from transgenic Drosophila strains coexpressing combinations of red and green fluorescent fusion proteins, fully capable of providing the essential wild-type functions. Thereby, Cenp-A/Cid, Cenp-C, Mis12 and the Ndc80 complex were mapped along the inter sister kinetochore axis with a resolution below 10 nm. The C terminus of Cenp-C was found to be near but well separated from the innermost component Cenp-A/Cid. The N terminus of Cenp-C is further out, clustered with Mis12 and the Spc25 end of the rod-like Ndc80 complex, which is known to bind to microtubules at its other more distal Ndc80/Nuf2 end. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {The centromere/kinetochore complex is indispensable for accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell divisions when it serves as the attachment site for spindle microtubules. Centromere identity in metazoans is believed to be governed by epigenetic mechanisms, because the highly repetitive centromeric DNA is neither sufficient nor required for specifying the assembly site of the kinetochore [1-4]. A candidate for an epigenetic mark is the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A that replaces H3 in alternating blocks of chromatin exclusively in active centromeres [1, 2, 5, 6]. CENP-A acts as an initiator of kinetochore assembly, but the detailed dynamics of the deposition of metazoan CENP-A and of other constitutive kinetochore components are largely unknown [1, 2, 7-10]. Here we show by quantitative fluorescence measurements in living early embryos that functional fluorescent fusion proteins of the Drosophila CENP-A and CENP-C homologs are rapidly incorporated into centromeres during anaphase. This incorporation is independent of ongoing DNA synthesis and pulling forces generated by the mitotic spindle, but strictly coupled to mitotic progression. Thus, our findings uncover a strikingly dynamic behavior of centromere components in anaphase. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The role of post-translational modification of histones in eukaryotic gene regulation is well recognized. Epigenetic silencing of genes via heritable chromatin modifications plays a major role in cell fate specification in higher organisms. We formulate a coarse-grained model of chromatin silencing in yeast and study the conditions under which the system becomes bistable, allowing for different epigenetic states. We also study the dynamics of the boundary between the two locally stable states of chromatin: silenced and unsilenced. The model could be of use in guiding the discussion on chromatin silencing in general. In the context of silencing in budding yeast, it helps us understand the phenotype of various mutants, some of which may be non-trivial to see without the help of a mathematical model. One such example is a mutation that reduces the rate of background acetylation of particular histone side chains that competes with the deacetylation by Sir2p. The resulting negative feedback due to a Sir protein depletion effect gives rise to interesting counter-intuitive consequences. Our mathematical analysis brings forth the different dynamical behaviors possible within the same molecular model and guides the formulation of more refined hypotheses that could be addressed experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Centromeres are present on each chromosome to direct proper segregation during cell division. The understanding of how the histone H3 variant, CENP-A, epigenetically marks the location of the centromere on the chromosome has been advanced, in part, through the study of histone complexes, nucleosomes, and nucleosomal complexes with nonhistone centromere proteins. In this chapter, we describe the preparation of recombinant versions of these complexes. The methodology is firmly rooted in classic nucleosome reconstitution methods, but we highlight the aspects of the preparations that diverge from those used for the methods established with canonical histones. We also provide a method for producing PCR-amplified nucleosomal DNA sequences in milligram quantities that is particularly useful for studies where multiple sequences and/or chemical modifications are desired. Lastly, we describe our approach to assemble and analyze a complex between the recombinant human CENP-A nucleosome and one of its binding partners, CENP-C.},

abstract = {Centromeres are specified epigenetically, and the histone H3 variant CENP-A is assembled into the chromatin of all active centromeres. Divergence from H3 raises the possibility that CENP-A generates unique chromatin features to mark physically centromere location. Here we report the crystal structure of a subnucleosomal heterotetramer, human (CENP-A-H4)2, that reveals three distinguishing properties encoded by the residues that comprise the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD; ref. 2): (1) a CENP-A-CENP-A interface that is substantially rotated relative to the H3-H3 interface; (2) a protruding loop L1 of the opposite charge as that on H3; and (3) strong hydrophobic contacts that rigidify the CENP-A-H4 interface. Residues involved in the CENP-A-CENP-A rotation are required for efficient incorporation into centromeric chromatin, indicating specificity for an unconventional nucleosome shape. DNA topological analysis indicates that CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are octameric with conventional left-handed DNA wrapping, in contrast to other recent proposals3-6. Our results indicate that CENP-A marks centromere location by restructuring the nucleosome from within its folded histone core. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Instead, a specialized form of chromatin containing the histone H3 variant, CENP-A, epigenetically specifies centromere location. We discuss current models where CENP-A serves as the marker for the centromere during the entire cell cycle in addition to generating the foundational chromatin for the kinetochore in mitosis. Recent elegant experiments have indicated that engineered arrays of CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are sufficient to serve as the site of kinetochore formation and for seeding centromeric chromatin that self-propagates through cell generations. Finally, recent structural and dynamic studies of CENP-A-containing histone complexes - before and after assembly into nucleosomes - provide models to explain underlying molecular mechanisms at the centromere. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Centromeres are specified by sequence-independent epigenetic mechanisms in most organisms. Rarely, centromere repositioning results in neocentromere formation at ectopic sites. However, the mechanisms governing how and where neocentromeres form are unknown. Here, we established a chromosome-engineering system in chicken DT40 cells that allowed us to efficiently isolate neocentromere-containing chromosomes. Neocentromeres appear to be structurally and functionally equivalent to native centromeres. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis with 18 neocentromeres revealed that the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A occupies an ∼40 kb region at each neocentromere, which has no preference for specific DNA sequence motifs. Furthermore, we found that neocentromeres were not associated with histone modifications H3K9me3, H3K4me2, and H3K36me3 or with early replication timing. Importantly, low but significant levels of CENP-A are detected around endogenous centromeres, which are capable of seeding neocentromere assembly if the centromere core is removed. In summary, our experimental system provides valuable insights for understanding how neocentromeres form. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Centromeres are specified epigenetically through the deposition of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A. However, how additional epigenetic features are involved in centromere specification is unknown. Here, we find that histone H4 Lys5 and Lys12 acetylation (H4K5ac and H4K12ac) primarily occur within the pre-nucleosomal CENP-A-H4-HJURP (CENP-A chaperone) complex, before centromere deposition. We show that H4K5ac and H4K12ac are mediated by the RbAp46/48-Hat1 complex and that RbAp48-deficient DT40 cells fail to recruit HJURP to centromeres and do not incorporate new CENP-A at centromeres. However, C-terminally-truncated HJURP, that does not bind CENP-A, does localize to centromeres in RbAp48-deficient cells. Acetylation-dead H4 mutations cause mis-localization of the CENP-A-H4 complex to non-centromeric chromatin. Crucially, CENP-A with acetylation-mimetic H4 was assembled specifically into centromeres even in RbAp48-deficient DT40 cells. We conclude that H4K5ac and H4K12ac, mediated by RbAp46/48, facilitates efficient CENP-A deposition into centromeres.},

CENP-A overexpression (OE) and mislocalization have been observed in cancers and correlate with poor prognosis; however, the molecular consequences of CENP-A OE on CIN and aneuploidy have not been defined. Here, we show that CENP-A OE leads to its mislocalization and CIN with lagging chromosomes and micronuclei in pseudodiploid DLD1 cells and xenograft mouse model. CIN is due to reduced localization of proteins to the kinetochore, resulting in defects in kinetochore integrity and unstable kinetochore–microtubule attachments. CENP-A OE contributes to reduced expression of cell adhesion genes and higher invasion of DLD1 cells. We show that CENP-A OE contributes to aneuploidy with karyotypic heterogeneity in human cells and xenograft mouse model. In summary, our results provide a molecular link between CENP-A OE and aneuploidy, and suggest that karyotypic heterogeneity may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of CENP-A–overexpressing cancers.},

Identity of these loci is maintained epigenetically by nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. Propagation of CENP-A chromatin is uncoupled from DNA replication initiating only during mitotic exit. We now demonstrate that inhibition of Cdk1 and Cdk2 activities is sufficient to trigger CENP-A assembly throughout the cell cycle in a manner dependent on the canonical CENP-A assembly machinery. We further show that the key CENP-A assembly factor Mis18BP1 HsKNL2 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner that controls its centromere localization during mitotic exit. These results strongly support a model in which the CENP-A assembly machinery is poised for activation throughout the cell cycle but kept in an inactive noncentromeric state by Cdk activity during S, G2, and M phases. Alleviation of this inhibition in G1 phase ensures tight coupling between DNA replication, cell division, and subsequent centromere maturation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Centromeres, the chromosomal loci that form the sites of attachment for spindle microtubules during mitosis, are identified by a unique chromatin structure generated by nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. The apparent epigenetic mode of centromere inheritance across mitotic and meiotic divisions has generated much interest in how CENP-A assembly occurs and how structurally divergent centromeric nucleosomes can specify the centromere complex. Although a substantial number of proteins have been implicated in centromere assembly, factors that can bind CENP-A specifically and deliver nascent protein to the centromere were, thus far, lacking. Several recent reports on experiments in fission yeast and human cells have now shown significant progress on this problem. Here, we discuss these new developments and their implications for epigenetic centromere inheritance. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract = {Aroma properties of spices are related to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present, which can provide distinct analytical signatures. The aim of the study was to examine similarity and diversity of VOC profiles of six common market spices (black/white pepper, chili paprika, cinnamon, nutmeg and saffron). The key volatiles were identified by PTR-TOFMS. Twelve samples per spice were subjected to PTR-Quadrupole MS (PTR-QMS) and Principal Component Analysis to compare the groups and examine diversity. With PTR-TOFMS, 101 volatile compounds were identified as total sum across all samples by mass and comparing them with literature data. Some spices comprised key character aroma compounds, e.g. cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon. For others, VOC groups, such as terpenes, acids and aldehydes topped the list. The PTR-QMS in combination with variables selection resulted in distinct PCA patterns for each spice. Variation within the spice groups was observed, but varied with the kind of spice. The results are valuable for future authentication studies.},

abstract = {Centromeres control genetic inheritance by directing chromosome segregation but are not genetically encoded themselves. Rather, centromeres are defined by nucleosomes containing CENP-A, a histone H3 variant [1]. In cycling somatic cells, centromere identity is maintained by an established cell-cycle-coupled CENP-A chromatin assembly pathway, but how centromeres are inherited through the mammalian female germline is unclear because of the long (months to decades) prophase I arrest. Here we show that mouse oocytes retain the pool of CENP-A nucleosomes assembled before birth, and that this pool is sufficient for centromere function, fertility, and genome transmission to embryos. Indeed, oocytes lack any measurable CENP-A nucleosome assembly through the entire fertile lifespan of the female (>1 year). Thus, the remarkable stability of CENP-A nucleosomes confers transgenerational centromere identity in mammals.},

abstract = {We characterize a novel human cohesinopathy originated from a familial germline mutation of the gene encoding the cohesin subunit STAG2, which we propose to call STAG2-related X-linked Intellectual Deficiency. Five individuals carry a STAG2 p.Ser327Asn (c.980 G > A) variant that perfectly cosegregates with a phenotype of syndromic mental retardation in a characteristic X-linked recessive pattern. Although patient-derived cells did not show overt sister-chromatid cohesion defects, they exhibited altered cell cycle profiles and gene expression patterns that were consistent with cohesin deficiency. The protein level of STAG2 in patient cells was normal. Interestingly, STAG2 S327 is located at a conserved site crucial for binding to SCC1 and cohesin regulators. When expressed in human cells, the STAG2 p.Ser327Asn mutant is defective in binding to SCC1 and other cohesin subunits and regulators. Thus, decreased amount of intact cohesin likely underlies the phenotypes of STAG2-SXLID. Intriguingly, recombinant STAG2 p.Ser327Asn binds normally to SCC1, WAPL, and SGO1 in vitro, suggesting the existence of unknown in vivo mechanisms that regulate the interaction between STAG2 and SCC1.},

abstract = {Chromatin featuring the H3 variant CENP-A at the centromere is critical for its mitotic function and epigenetic maintenance. Assembly of centromeric chromatin is restricted to G1 phase through inhibitory action of Cdk1/2 kinases in other phases of the cell cycle. Here, we identify the two key targets sufficient to maintain cell-cycle control of CENP-A assembly. We uncovered a single phosphorylation site in the licensing factor M18BP1 and a cyclin A binding site in the CENP-A chaperone, HJURP, that mediated specific inhibitory phosphorylation. Simultaneous expression of mutant proteins lacking these residues results in complete uncoupling from the cell cycle. Consequently, CENP-A assembly is fully recapitulated under high Cdk activities, indistinguishable from G1 assembly. We find that Cdk-mediated inhibition is exerted by sequestering active factors away from the centromere. Finally, we show that displacement of M18BP1 from the centromere is critical for the assembly mechanism of CENP-A.},

We review how specific quantitative microscopy approaches have contributed to the determination of the copy number, architecture, size, and dynamics of centromeric chromatin and its associated centromere complex and kinetochore. These efforts revealed that the key to long-term centromere maintenance is the slow turnover of CENP-A nucleosomes, a critical size of the chromatin domain and its cell cycle-coupled replication.

abstract = {The centromere is the chromosomal region that directs kinetochore assembly during mitosis in order to facilitate the faithful segregation of sister chromatids. The location of the human centromere is epigenetically specified. The presence of nucleosomes that contain the histone H3 variant, CENP-A, are thought to be the epigenetic mark that indicates active centromeres. Maintenance of centromeric identity requires the deposition of new CENP-A nucleosomes with each cell cycle. During S-phase, existing CENP-A nucleosomes are divided among the daughter chromosomes, while new CENP-A nucleosomes are deposited during early G1. The specific assembly of CENP-A nucleosomes at centromeres requires the Mis18 complex, which recruits the CENP-A assembly factor, HJURP. We will review the unique features of centromeric chromatin as well as the mechanism of CENP-A nucleosome deposition. We will also highlight a few recent discoveries that begin to elucidate the factors that temporally and spatially control CENP-A deposition. {\textcopyright} Springer Basel AG 2012.},

They constitute the genomic regions on which kinetochores form and when defective cause segregation defects that can lead to aneuploidy and cancer. Here, we discuss how CENP-A is established and maintained to propagate centromere identity while subjected to dynamic chromatin remodelling during essential cellular processes like DNA repair, replication, and transcription. We highlight parallels and identify conserved mechanisms between different model organism with a particular focus on 1) the establishment of CENP-A at centromeres, 2) CENP-A maintenance during transcription and replication, and 3) the mechanisms that help preventing CENP-A localization at non-centromeric sites. We then give examples of how timely loading of new CENP-A to the centromere, maintenance of old CENP-A during S-phase and transcription, and removal of CENP-A at non-centromeric sites are coordinated and controlled by an intricate network of factors whose identity is slowly being unravelled.},

abstract = {The conserved mitotic kinase Bub1 performs multiple functions that are only partially characterized. Besides its role in the spindle assembly checkpoint and chromosome alignment, Bub1 is crucial for the kinetochore recruitment of multiple proteins, among them Sgo1. Both Bub1 and Sgo1 are dispensable for growth of haploid and diploid budding yeast, but they become essential in cells with higher ploidy. We find that overexpression of SGO1 partially corrects the chromosome segregation defect of bub1$\Delta$ haploid cells and restores viability to bub1$\Delta$ tetraploid cells. Using an unbiased high-copy suppressor screen, we identified two members of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), BIR1 (survivin) and SLI15 (INCENP, inner centromere protein), as suppressors of the growth defect of both bub1$\Delta$ and sgo1$\Delta$ tetraploids, suggesting that these mutants die due to defects in chromosome biorientation. Overexpression of BIR1 or SLI15 also complements the benomyl sensitivity of haploid bub1$\Delta$ and sgo1$\Delta$ cells. Mutants lacking SGO1 fail to biorient sister chromatids attached to the same spindle pole (syntelic attachment) after nocodazole treatment. Moreover, the sgo1$\Delta$ cells accumulate syntelic attachments in unperturbed mitoses, a defect that is partially corrected by BIR1 or SLI15 overexpression. We show that in budding yeast neither Bub1 nor Sgo1 is required for CPC localization or affects Aurora B activity. Instead we identify Sgo1 as a possible partner of Mps1, a mitotic kinase suggested to have an Aurora B-independent function in establishment of biorientation. We found that Sgo1 overexpression rescues defects caused by metaphase inactivation of Mps1 and that Mps1 is required for Sgo1 localization to the kinetochore. We propose that Bub1, Sgo1, and Mps1 facilitate chromosome biorientation independently of the Aurora B-mediated pathway at the budding yeast kinetochore and that both pathways are required for the efficient turnover of syntelic attachments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Storchov{\'{a}} et al.},

abstract = {The kinetochore forms a dynamic interface with microtubules from the mitotic spindle. Live-cell light microscopy-based observations on the dynamic structural changes within the kinetochore suggest that molecular rearrangements within the kinetochore occur upon microtubule interaction. However, the source of these rearrangements is still unclear. In this paper, we analyze vertebrate kinetochore ultrastructure by immunoelectron microscopy (EM) in the presence or absence of tension from spindle microtubules. We found that the inner kinetochore region defined by CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-R, and the C-terminal domain of CENP-T is deformed in the presence of tension, whereas the outer kinetochore region defined by Ndc80, Mis12, and CENP-E is not stretched even under tension. Importantly, based on EM, fluorescence microscopy, and in vitro analyses, we demonstrated that the N and C termini of CENP-T undergo a tension-dependent separation, suggesting that CENP-T elongation is at least partly responsible for changes in the shape of the inner kinetochore. {\textcopyright} 2011 Suzuki et al.},

abstract = {The centromere is a specific genomic region upon which the kinetochore is formed to attach to spindle microtubules for faithful chromosome segregation. To distinguish this chromosomal region from other genomic loci, the centromere contains a specific chromatin structure including specialized nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. In addition to CENP-A nucleosomes, we have found that centromeres contain a nucleosome-like structure comprised of the histone-fold CENP-T-W-S-X complex. However, it is unclear how the CENP-T-W-S-X complex associates with centromere chromatin. Here, we demonstrate that the CENP-T-W-S-X complex binds preferentially to ∼100 bp of linker DNA rather than nucleosome-bound DNA. In addition, we find that the CENP-T-W-S-X complex primarily binds to DNA as a (CENP-T-W-S-X)2 structure. Interestingly, in contrast to canonical nucleosomes that negatively supercoil DNA, the CENP-T-W-S-X complex induces positive DNA supercoils. We found that the DNA-binding regions in CENP-T or CENP-W, but not CENP-S or CENP-X, are required for this positive supercoiling activity and the kinetochore targeting of the CENP-T-W-S-X complex. In summary, our work reveals the structural features and properties of the CENP-T-W-S-X complex for its localization to centromeres. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) 2013.

abstract = {The histone H3 variant CENP-A is a crucial epigenetic marker for centromere specification. CENP-A forms a characteristic nucleosome and dictates the higher-order configuration of centromeric chromatin. However, little is known about how the CENP-A nucleosome affects the architecture of centromeric chromatin. In this study, we reconstituted tri-nucleosomes mimicking a centromeric nucleosome arrangement containing the CENP-A nucleosome, and determined their 3D structures by cryoelectron microscopy. The H3-CENP-A-H3 tri-nucleosomes adopt an untwisted architecture, with an outward-facing linker DNA path between nucleosomes. This is distinct from the H3-H3-H3 tri-nucleosome architecture, with an inward-facing DNA path. Intriguingly, the untwisted architecture may allow the CENP-A nucleosome to be exposed to the solvent in the condensed chromatin model. These results provide a structural basis for understanding the 3D configuration of CENP-A-containing chromatin, and may explain how centromeric proteins can specifically target the CENP-A nucleosomes buried in robust amounts of H3 nucleosomes in centromeres. The centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A, is a crucial epigenetic marker for designating centromeres as sites for kinetochore assembly.

Two additional functions of the centromere, however, are becoming increasingly clear: facilitation of robust sister-chromatid cohesion at pericentromeres and advancement of replication of centromeric regions. The combination of these three centromere functions ensures correct chromosome segregation during mitosis. Here, we review the mechanisms of the kinetochore-microtubule interaction, focusing on sister-kinetochore bi-orientation (or chromosome bi-orientation). We also discuss the biological importance of robust pericentromeric cohesion and early centromere replication, as well as the mechanisms orchestrating these two functions at the microtubule attachment site. {\textcopyright} 2013 EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ORGANIZATION.},

abstract = {Loss of sister-chromatid cohesion triggers chromosome segregation in mitosis and occurs through two mechanisms in vertebrate cells: (1) phosphorylation and removal of cohesin from chromosome arms by mitotic kinases, including Plk1, during prophase, and (2) cleavage of centromeric cohesin by separase at the metaphase-anaphase transition. Bub1 and the MEI-S332/Shugoshin (Sgo1) family of proteins protect centromeric cohesin from mitotic kinases during prophase. We show that human Sgo1 binds to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PP2A localizes to centromeres in a Bub1-dependent manner. The Sgo1-PP2A interaction is required for centromeric localization of Sgo1 and proper chromosome segregation in human cells. Depletion of Plk1 by RNA interference (RNAi) restores centromeric localization of Sgo1 and prevents chromosome missegregation in cells depleted of PP2A_A$\alpha$. Our findings suggest that Bub1 targets PP2A to centromeres, which in turn maintains Sgo1 at centromeres by counteracting Plk1-mediated chromosome removal of Sgo1. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report that Bub1 retains centromeric cohesion in mitosis of human cells. Depletion of Bub1 or Shugoshin (Sgo1) in HeLa cells by RNA interference causes massive missegregation of sister chromatids that originates at centromeres. Surprisingly, loss of chromatid cohesion in Bub1 and Sgo1 RNA-interference cells does not appear to require the full activation of separase but, instead, triggers a mitotic arrest that depends on Mad2 and Aurora B. Bub1 maintains the steady-state levels and centromeric localization of Sgo1. Therefore, Bub1 protects centromeric cohesion through Shugoshin in mitosis.},

abstract = {Shugoshin (Sgo) is a conserved centromeric protein. Mammalian Sgo1 collaborates with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to protect mitotic cohesin from the prophase dissociation pathway. Although another shugoshin-like protein, Sgo2, is required for the centromeric protection of cohesion in germ cells, its precise molecular functionremains largely elusive. We demonstrate that hSgo2 plays a dual role in chromosome congression and centromeric protection of cohesion in HeLa cells, while the latter function is exposed only in perturbed mitosis. These functions partly overlap with those of Aurora B, a kinase setting faithful chromosome segregation. Accordingly, we identified the phosphorylation of hSgo2 by Aurora B at the N-terminal coiled-coil region and the middle region, and showed that these phosphorylations separately promote binding of hSgo2 to PP2A and MCAK, factors required for centromeric protection and chromosome congression, respectively. Furthermore, these phosphorylations are essential for localizing PP2A and MCAK to centromeres. This mechanism seems applicable to germ cells as well. Thus, our study identifies Sgo2 as a hitherto unknown crucial cellular substrate of Aurora B in mammalian cells. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CIN still remain elusive.We found that a number of CIN+ cell lines have impairments in the integrity of the conserved inner centromere-shugoshin (ICS) network, which coordinates sister chromatid cohesion and kinetochore-microtubule attachment. These defects are caused mostly by the loss of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation at centromeres and sometimes by a reduction in chromatin-associated cohesin; both pathways separately sustain centromeric shugoshin stability. Artificial restoration of the ICS network suppresses chromosome segregation errors in a wide range of CIN+ cells, including RB- and BRCA1-deficient cells. Thus, dysfunction of the ICS network might be a key mechanism underlying CIN in human tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Successful partition of replicated genomes at cell division requires chromosome attachment to opposite poles of mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). Any defects in this regulation bring about chromosomal instability, which may accelerate tumour progression in humans. To achieve chromosome bi-orientation at prometaphase, the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of catalytic kinase Aurora B and regulatory components (INCENP, Survivin and Borealin), must be localized to centromeres to phosphorylate kinetochore substrates. Although the CPC dynamically changes the subcellular localization, the regulation of centromere targeting is largely unknown. Here we isolated a fission yeast cyclin B mutant defective specifically in chromosome bi-orientation. Accordingly, we identified Cdk1 (also known as Cdc2)-B-dependent phosphorylation of Survivin. Preventing Survivin phosphorylation impairs centromere CPC targeting as well as chromosome bi-orientation, whereas phosphomimetic Survivin suppresses the bi-orientation defect in the cyclin B mutant. Survivin phosphorylation promotes direct binding with shugoshin, which we now define as a conserved centromeric adaptor of the CPC. In human cells, the phosphorylation of Borealin has a comparable role. Thus, our study resolves the conserved mechanisms of CPC targeting to centromeres, highlighting a key role of Cdk1-cyclin B in chromosome bi-orientation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {All living organisms require accurate mechanisms to faithfully inherit their genetic material during cell division. The centromere is a unique locus on each chromosome that supports a multiprotein structure called the kinetochore. During mitosis, the kinetochore is responsible for connecting chromosomes to spindle microtubules, allowing faithful segregation of the duplicated genome. In most organisms, centromere position and function is not defined by the local DNA sequence context but rather by an epigenetic chromatinbased mechanism. Centromere protein A (CENPA) is central to this process, as chromatin assembled from this histone H3 variant is essential for assembly of the centromere complex, as well as for its epigenetic maintenance. As a major determinant of centromere function, CENP-A assembly requires tight control, both in its specificity for the centromere and in timing of assembly. In the last few years, there have been several new insights into the molecular mechanism that allow this process to occur. We will review these here and discuss the general implications of the mechanism of cell cycle coupling of centromere inheritance. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

abstract = {Linoleic acid (LA) is a major constituent of low-density lipoproteins. An essential fatty acid, LA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid, which is oxidised by endogenous enzymes and reactive oxygen species in the circulation. Increased levels of low-density lipoproteins coupled with oxidative stress and lack of antioxidants drive the oxidative processes. This results in synthesis of a range of oxidised derivatives, which play a vital role in regulation of inflammatory processes. The derivatives of LA include, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, oxo-​octadecadienoic acids, epoxy octadecadecenoic acid and epoxy-keto-octadecenoic acids. In this review, we examine the role of LA derivatives and their actions on regulation of inflammation relevant to metabolic processes associated with atherogenesis and cancer. The processes affected by LA derivatives include, alteration of airway smooth muscles and vascular wall, affecting sensitivity to pain, and regulating endogenous steroid hormones associated with metabolic syndrome. LA derivatives alter cell adhesion molecules, this initial step, is pivotal in regulating inflammatory processes involving transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathways, thus, leading to alteration of metabolic processes. The derivatives are known to elicit pleiotropic effects that are either beneficial or detrimental in nature hence making it difficult to determine the exact role of these derivatives in the progress of an assumed target disorder. The key may lie in understanding the role of these derivatives at various stages of development of a disorder. Novel pharmacological approaches in altering the synthesis or introduction of synthesised LA derivatives could possibly help drive processes that could regulate inflammation in a beneficial manner.

abstract = {During cell division, interactions between microtubules and chromosomes are mediated by the kinetochore, a proteinaceous structure located at the primary constriction of chromosomes. In addition to the centromere histone centromere protein A (CENP-A), 15 other members of the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) participate in the formation of a chromatin-associated scaffold that supports kinetochore structure. We performed a targeted screen analyzing unfolded centrochromatin from CENP-depleted chromosomes. Our results revealed that CENP-C and CENP-S are critical for the stable folding of mitotic kinetochore chromatin. Multipeak fitting algorithms revealed the presence of an organized pattern of centrochromatin packing consistent with arrangement of CENPA- containing nucleosomes into up to five chromatin "subunits" - each containing roughly 20-30 nucleosomes. These subunits could be either layers of a boustrophedon or small loops of centromeric chromatin.},

abstract = {To protect against aneuploidy, chromosomes must attach to microtubules from opposite poles ('biorientation') prior to their segregation during mitosis. Biorientation relies on the correction of erroneous attachments by the aurora B kinase, which destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments that lack tension. Incorrect attachments are also avoided because sister kinetochores are intrinsically biased towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles. Here, we show that shugoshin acts as a pericentromeric adaptor that plays dual roles in biorientation in budding yeast. Shugoshin maintains the aurora B kinase at kinetochores that lack tension, thereby engaging the error correction machinery. Shugoshin also recruits the chromosome-organizing complex, condensin, to the pericentromere. Pericentromeric condensin biases sister kinetochores towards capture by microtubules from opposite poles. Our findings uncover the molecular basis of the bias to sister kinetochore capture and expose shugoshin as a pericentromeric hub controlling chromosome biorientation. {\textcopyright} Verzijlbergen et al.},

abstract = {The food supplement quercetin is used as self-medication for prostate disorders and is known to induce vasorelaxation. The drug tamsulosin is used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. A major side effect of tamsulosin is orthostatic hypotension, mediated by vasorelaxation resulting from $\alpha$1-adrenoceptor blockade. The overlapping profile prompted us to investigate the pharmacodynamic interaction of quercetin with tamsulosin. Since quercetin is extensively metabolized in the intestines and the liver, the metabolites quercetin-3-glucuronide and 4′O-methyl-quercetin were also examined. Vasorelaxation induced by the compounds was tested in rat mesenteric arteries (average diameter: 360± $\mu$m) constricted by the $\alpha$1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Tamsulosin (0.1 nM) decreased phenylephrine sensitivity 17-fold (n=10). Quercetin (5, 10 and 20 $\mu$M) also caused a decrease (2-, 4- and 6-fold respectively) of phenylephrine sensitivity, while 10 $\mu$M of quercetin-3-glucuronide and 4′O-methyl-quercetin decreased this sensitivity (1.5- and 2-fold) only slightly (n=6). The combination of tamsulosin with quercetin or quercetin metabolites proved to be far more potent than the compounds in isolation. The combination of quercetin, quercetin-3-glucuronide or 4′O-methyl-quercetin with tamsulosin decreased the phenylephrine sensitivity approximately 200-, 35- and 150-fold (n=6). The strong pharmacodynamic interaction between the food supplement quercetin and tamsulosin underlines the potential of the impact of supplement-drug interactions that warrant more research.},

abstract = {Centromeres are epigenetically determined chromosomal loci that seed kinetochore assembly to promote chromosome segregation during cell division. CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, establishes the foundations for centromere epigenetic memory and kinetochore assembly. It recruits the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), which in turn assembles the microtubule-binding interface. How the specific organization of centromeric chromatin relates to kinetochore assembly and to centromere identity through cell division remains conjectural. Here, we break new ground by reconstituting a functional full-length version of CENP-C, the largest human CCAN subunit and a blueprint of kinetochore assembly. We show that full-length CENP-C, a dimer, binds stably to two nucleosomes and permits further assembly of all other kinetochore subunits in vitro with relative ratios closely matching those of endogenous human kinetochores. Our results imply that human kinetochores emerge from clustering multiple copies of a fundamental module and may have important implications for transgenerational inheritance of centromeric chromatin.},

abstract = {The kinetochore is essential for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis. To form a functional kinetochore, constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) proteins are assembled on the centromere chromatin that contains the centromere-specific histone CENP-A. CENP-C, a CCAN protein, directly interacts with the CENP-A nucleosome to nucleate the kinetochore structure. As CENP-C is a hub protein for kinetochore assembly, it is critical to address how the CENP-A-CENP-C interaction is regulated during cell cycle progression. To address this question, we investigated the CENP-C C-terminal region, including a conserved CENP-A-binding motif, in both chicken and human cells and found that CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of CENP-C facilitates its binding to CENP-A in vitro and in vivo. We observed that CENP-A binding is involved in CENP-C kinetochore localization during mitosis. We also demonstrate that the CENP-A-CENP-C interaction is critical for long-term viability in human RPE-1 cells. These results provide deeper insights into protein-interaction network plasticity in centromere proteins during cell cycle progression.},

abstract = {Successful partitioning of chromosomes in mitosis relies on the bipolar attachment of sister chromatids at metaphase. For this biorientation, the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of catalytic kinase Aurora B and regulatory components (INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin), must be localized at the center of paired kinetochores, the site called the inner centromere. It is largely unknown what defines the inner centromere and how the CPC is targeted to this site. Recent studies point out that the shugoshin protein (SGO), originally identified as a cohesin protector, also acts as a conserved centromeric adapter of the CPC. Phosphorylation of the CPC by Cdk1 promotes direct binding with shugoshin, thus explaining how the CPC is targeted to the centromere in a timely manner at prometaphase during the cell cycle. Moreover, the phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine 3 (H3-pT3) mediated by Haspin cooperates with Bub1-mediated H2A-S121 phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere. H3-pT3 promotes nucleosome binding of Survivin, whereas H2A-pS121 facilitates the binding of shugoshin. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5, a cohesin-binding protein, and Bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, the inner centromere is defined by the spatial intersection of two histone marks mediated by cohesin- and kinetochore-associated kinases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Meiosis produces haploid gametes from diploid cells in two stages that in many ways resemble mitosis. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing kinetochore orientation and cohesion at the first meiotic division are different from those at mitosis: sister kinetochores are pulled forwards from the same spindle pole at metaphase, and centromeric cohesion is protected throughout anaphase. Consequently, homologous chromosomes, rather than sister chromatids, segregate to the opposite sides of a cell. The residual cohesion around centromeres plays an essential role at the second meiotic division, when spindle microtubules from opposite poles attach to sister chromatids. Recent studies have identified novel meiosis-specific kinetochore proteins, such as monopolin and shugoshin, and indicate that specific modifications in sister chromatid cohesion lie at the heart of the regulation of meiotic chromosome segregation.},

abstract = {A recently emerging protein family, shugoshin, plays a crucial role in the centromeric protection of cohesin, which is responsible for sister chromatid cohesion. This is especially important at the first meiotic division, where cohesin is cleaved by separase only along chromosome arms while the centromeric cohesin must be preserved. In vertebrate cells, arm cohesion is largely lost during prophase and prometaphase in order to facilitate sister chromatid resolution, whereas centromeric cohesion is preserved until the bipolar attachment of sister chromatids is established. Vertebrate shugoshin plays an essential role in protecting centromeric cohesin from prophase dissociation. In yeast, shugoshin also has a crucial role in sensing the loss of tension at kinetochores and in generating the spindle checkpoint signal. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A protein required to protect centromeric cohesin Rec8 from separase cleavage has been identified and named shugoshin (or Sgo1) after shugoshin ('guardian spirit' in Japanese). It has become apparent that shugoshin shows marginal homology with Drosophila Mei-S332 and several uncharacterized proteins in other eukaryotic organisms. Because Mei-S332 is a protein previously shown to be required for centromeric cohesion in meiosis, it is now established that shugoshin represents a conserved protein family defined as a centromeric protector of Rec8 cohesin complexes in meiosis. The regional difference of sister chromatid cohesion is also observed during mitosis in vertebrates; the cohesion is much more robust at the centromere at metaphase, where it antagonizes the pulling force of spindle microtubules that attach the kinetochores from opposite poles. The human shugoshin homologue (hSgo1) is required to protect the centromeric localization of the mitotic cohesin, Scc1, until metaphase. Bub1 plays a crucial role in the localization of shugoshin to centromeres in both fission yeast and humans. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Metaphase chromosomes are visible hallmarks of mitosis, yet our understanding of their structure and of the forces shaping them is rudimentary. Phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3 S10) by Aurora B kinase is a signature event of mitosis, but its function in chromatin condensation is unclear. Using genetically encoded ultraviolet light-inducible cross-linkers, we monitored protein-protein interactions with spatiotemporal resolution in living yeast to identify the molecular details of the pathway downstream of H3 S10 phosphorylation. This modification leads to the recruitment of the histone deacetylase Hst2p that subsequently removes an acetyl group from histone H4 lysine 16, freeing the H4 tail to interact with the surface of neighboring nucleosomes and promoting fiber condensation. This cascade of events provides a condensin-independent driving force of chromatin hypercondensation during mitosis.},

abstract = {Correct bioriented attachment of sister chromatids to the mitotic spindle is essential for chromosome segregation. In budding yeast, the conserved protein shugoshin (Sgo1) contributes to biorientation by recruiting the protein phosphatase PP2A-Rts1 and the condensin complex to centromeres. Using peptide prints, we identified a Serine-Rich Motif (SRM) of Sgo1 that mediates the interaction with condensin and is essential for centromeric condensin recruitment and the establishment of biorientation. We show that the interaction is regulated via phosphorylation within the SRM and we determined the phospho-sites using mass spectrometry. Analysis of the phosphomimic and phosphoresistant mutants revealed that SRM phosphorylation disrupts the shugoshin–condensin interaction. We present evidence that Mps1, a central kinase in the spindle assembly checkpoint, directly phosphorylates Sgo1 within the SRM to regulate the interaction with condensin and thereby condensin localization to centromeres. Our findings identify novel mechanisms that control shugoshin activity at the centromere in budding yeast.},

abstract = {For proper partitioning of chromosomes in mitosis, the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) including Aurora B and survivin must be localized at the center of paired kinetochores, at the site called the inner centromere. It is largely unknown what defines the inner centromere and how the CPC is targeted to this site. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of histone H3-threonine 3 (H3-pT3) mediated by Haspin cooperates with Bub1-mediated histone 2A-serine 121 (H2A-S121) phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere in fission yeast and human cells. H3-pT3 promotes nucleosome binding of survivin, whereas phosphorylated H2A-S121 facilitates the binding of shugoshin, the centromeric CPC adaptor. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5, whereas Bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, the inner centromere is defined by intersection of two histone kinases.},

@article{Yamagishi2008,
abstract = {The centromere of a chromosome is composed mainly of two domains, a kinetochore assembling core centromere and peri-centromeric heterochromatin regions. The crucial role of centromeric heterochromatin is still unknown, because even in simpler unicellular organisms such as the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the heterochromatin protein Swi6 (HP1 homologue) has several functions at centromeres, including silencing gene expression and recombination, enriching cohesin, promoting kinetochore assembly, and, ultimately, preventing erroneous microtubule attachment to the kinetochores. Here we show that the requirement of heterochromatin for mitotic chromosome segregation is largely replaced by forcibly enriching cohesin at centromeres in fission yeast. However, this enrichment of cohesin is not sufficient to replace the meiotic requirement for heterochromatin. We find that the heterochromatin protein Swi6 associates directly with meiosis-specific shugoshin Sgo1, a protector of cohesin at centromeres. A point mutation of Sgo1 (V242E), which abolishes the interaction with Swi6, impairs the centromeric localization and function of Sgo1. The forced centromeric localization of Sgo1 restores proper meiotic chromosome segregation in swi6$\Delta$ cells. We also show that the direct link between HP1 and shugoshin is conserved in human cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the recruitment of shugoshin is the important primary role for centromeric heterochromatin in ensuring eukaryotic chromosome segregation. {\textcopyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {We have identified a novel human centromere-associated protein by preparing monoclonal antibodies against a fraction of HeLa chromosome scaffold proteins enriched for centromere/kinetochore components. One monoclonal antibody (mAb177) specifically stains the centromere region of mitotic human chromosomes and binds to a novel, $\sim$250-300 kd chromosome scaffold associated protein named CENP-E. In cells progressing through different parts of the cell cycle, the localization of CENP-E differed markedly from that observed for the previously identified centromere proteins CENP-A, CENP-B, CENP-C and CENP-D. In contrast to these antigens, no mAb177 staining is detected during interphase, and staining first appears at the centromere region of chromosomes during prometaphase. This association with chromosomes remains throughout metaphase but is redistributed to the midplate at or just after the onset of anaphase. By telophase, the staining is localized exclusively to the midbody. Microinjection of the mAb177 into metaphase cells blocks or significantly delays progression into anaphase, although the morphology of the spindle and the configuration of the metaphase chromosomes appear normal in these metaphase arrested cells. This demonstrates that CENP-E function is required for the transition from metaphase to anaphase.},

abstract = {Homologue segregation during the first meiotic division requires the proper spatial regulation of sister chromatid cohesion and its dissolution along chromo some arms, but its protection at centromeric regions. This protection requires the conserved MEI-S332/Sgo1 proteins that localize to centromeric regions and also recruit the PP2A phosphatase by binding its regulatory subunit, Rts1. Centromeric Rts1/PP2A then locally prevents cohesion dissolution possibly by dephosphorylating the protein complex cohesin. We show that Aurora B kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ipl1) is also essential for the protection of meiotic centromeric cohesion. Coupled with a previous study in Drosophila melanogaster, this meiotic function of Aurora B kinase appears to be conserved among eukaryotes. Furthermore, we show that Sgo1 recruits Ipl1 to centromeric regions. In the absence of Ipl1, Rts1 can initially bind to centromeric regions but disappears from these regions after anaphase I onset. We suggest that centromeric Ipl1 ensures the continued centromeric presence of active Rts1/PP2A, which in turn locally protects cohesin and cohesion. {\textcopyright} The Rockefeller University Press.},

abstract = {Accurate partition of duplicated genetic material to the daughter cells during mitosis relies on the maintenance of the physical linkage (cohesion) between sister chromatids until their bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle. In response to a single straying chromatid within a cell, a surveillance mechanism called the spindle checkpoint blocks the ubiquitin ligase activity of the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C), stabilizes securin (an APC/C substrate and an inhibitor of separase), and delays the activation of separase. This in turn prevents cleavage of cohesin by separase, preserves sister chromatid cohesion, and delays the onset of anaphase. The protein kinase, Bub1, is a key component of the spindle checkpoint. Bub1 has an upstream function in regulating the kinetochore localization of Mad2 and other downstream checkpoint components. In addition, recent biochemical studies have shown that Bub1 directly phosphorylates the APC/C activator, Cdc20, and inhibits APC/C. Finally, Bub1 has a noncheckpoint function at the kinetochores and preserves centromeric cohesion through the MEI-S332/shugoshin family of proteins. Therefore, Bub1 performs multiple tasks in mitosis that ensure the proper inheritance of chromosomes. {\textcopyright}2005 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Centromeric chromatin defines the site of kinetochore formation and ensures faithful chromosome segregation. Centromeric identity is epigenetically specified by the incorporation of CENP-A nucleosomes. DNA replication presents a challenge for inheritance of centromeric identity because nucleosomes are removed to allow for replication fork progression. Despite this challenge, CENP-A nucleosomes are stably retained through S phase. We used BioID to identify proteins transiently associated with CENP-A during DNA replication. We found that during S phase, HJURP transiently associates with centromeres and binds to pre-existing CENP-A, suggesting a distinct role for HJURP in CENP-A retention. We demonstrate that HJURP is required for centromeric nucleosome inheritance during S phase. HJURP co-purifies with the MCM2-7 helicase complex and, together with the MCM2 subunit, binds CENP-A simultaneously. Therefore, pre-existing CENP-A nucleosomes require an S phase function of the HJURP chaperone and interaction with MCM2 to ensure faithful inheritance of centromere identity through DNA replication. Inheritance of centromere identity requires the transmission of CENP-A across DNA replication, when nucleosomes are disassembled ahead of the replication fork. Zasadzi{\'{n}}ska et al. demonstrate that CENP-A requires the dedicated CENP-A chaperone HJURP and interaction with the replicative helicase complex to retain and redeposit CENP-A following DNA replication.},

@article{Zeitlin2009,
abstract = {The histone H3 variant CENP-A is required for epigenetic specification of centromere identity through a loading mechanism independent of DNA sequence. Using multiphoton absorption and DNA cleavage at unique sites by I-SceI endonuclease, we demonstrate that CENP-A is rapidly recruited to double-strand breaks in DNA, along with three components (CENP-N, CENP-T, and CENP-U) associated with CENP-A at centromeres. The centromere-targeting domain of CENP-A is both necessary and sufficient for recruitment to double-strand breaks. CENP-A accumulation at DNA breaks is enhanced by active nonhomologous end-joining but does not require DNA-PKcs or Ligase IV, and is independent of H2AX. Thus, induction of a double-strand break is sufficient to recruit CENP-A in human and mouse cells. Finally, since cell survival after radiation-induced DNA damage correlates with CENP-A expression level, we propose that CENP-A may have a function in DNA repair.},

@article{Zhou2022,
abstract = {The histone variant CENP-A is the epigenetic determinant for the centromere, where it is interspersed with canonical H3 to form a specialized chromatin structure that nucleates the kinetochore. How nucleosomes at the centromere arrange into higher order structures is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the human CENP-A-interacting protein CENP-N promotes the stacking of CENP-A-containing mononucleosomes and nucleosomal arrays through a previously undefined interaction between the $\alpha$6 helix of CENP-N with the DNA of a neighboring nucleosome. We describe the cryo-EM structures and biophysical characterization of such CENP-N-mediated nucleosome stacks and nucleosomal arrays and demonstrate that this interaction is responsible for the formation of densely packed chromatin at the centromere in the cell. Our results provide first evidence that CENP-A, together with CENP-N, promotes specific chromatin higher order structure at the centromere.},
