\subsection{Questions}
Is the bi-stability from positive feedback able to explain the distinct densities cen vs arm?
how is low density at cen maintained if so? 
how do islands form?

model is lacking

\subsection{Modelling goals}
bi-stability (centromere enrichment over arms)
low density (low absolute density)
island pattern (islands)
asymptotic behavior

Method

\subsection{The model}
assumptions and explanations

General:
• Fixed number of nucleosomes at centromere (0 and 1)
• No CENP-A nucleosome loss except dilution
• At each cell cycle, CENP-A nucleosomes are first replenished and then diluted 
Replenishment:
H3 nucleosomes are converted to CENP-A nucleosomes due to existing CENP-A nucleosomes nearby 
Dilution:
• CENP-A nucleosomes are randomly distributed to daughter centromeres
• H3 nucleosomes take over all empty positions

\subsection{Implementation}
Initialisation
Replenishment
Dilution


Result

2.3.1.	The basic model exhibits two types of behaviour
2.3.2.	Mean-field approximation is able to qualitatively explains the simulation results
2.3.3.	Global cooperative deposition generates bi-stability but cannot maintain a low density at the higher steady state
2.3.4.	Arbitrary number control leads to the formation of few CENP-A clusters
2.3.5.	Spontaneous conversion can recapitulate the island pattern but not bi-stability

Discussion
Summary table!
B 
Local deposition promotes island pattern but not sufficient to maintain it
consistent with positive feedback nature
G 
Positive feedback, Cooperativity and Non-local interaction are required for bi-stability
But the density is way higher than experimental data
Unlikely to be the mechanism
Alternative explanation would be 3D 
ANC
Active monitoring of CENP-A is unlikely 
Striking similarity with the reaction diffusion model
SC 
Any weak non-local mechanism will do, such as long-range deposition
TS+SC
nn matters
Important to test KT forming threshold and how does it compare to the level of noise
