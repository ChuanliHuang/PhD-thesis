Introduction
\subsection{The chromatin dynamics of CENP-A molecules}
self-propagation over generations
  - observation
  - the positive feedback
  - CENP-B
  - transcription
stably incorporated 
  - observation
  - transcription
  - replication
centromere enrichment but low density
  - the quantitative study
  - ectopic site eviction (replication, expression timing, PTM)
island pattern
  - observation 

\subsection{Questions}
Is the bi-stability from positive feedback able to explain the distinct densities cen vs arm?
how is low density at cen maintained if so? 
how do islands form?

model is lacking

\subsection{Modelling goals}
bi-stability (centromere enrichment over arms)
low density (low absolute density)
island pattern (islands)
asymptotic behavior
