  Big future directions of how centromeres and pericentromeres can be understood better by the types of approaches you had done in your PhD.

  -theory and experiment (pros and cons)
  -imbalance of theory and experiment in  biology and its damaging results
    -growth of literature full of data with weak interpretation
    -communication gap between experimentalists and theoreticians
    -work ethic: overly emphasise data collection over developing theory, rather than doing the right experiment, keep doing experiments blindly 
  -Incompatibility of theoretical and experimental work at the same time
