concluding the work
This work studied the spatial organisation and dynamics of two important centromeric proteins


no obvious link between CENP-A spatial organization and tension sensing
  -seems to be intra-kt tension that is sensed
  -final test 


Big future directions of how centromeres and pericentromeres can be understood better by the types of approaches you had done in your PhD.
  -theory and experiment (pros and cons)
  -imbalance of theory and experiment in  biology and its damaging results (More theory is needed)
    -growth of literature full of data with weak interpretation
    -communication gap between experimentalists and theoreticians
    -work ethic: overly emphasise data collection over developing theory, rather than doing the right experiment, keep doing experiments blindly 
  -Incompatibility of theoretical and experimental work at the same time
