concluding the work
This work studied the spatial organisation and dynamics of two important centromeric proteins


no obvious link between CENP-A spatial organization and tension sensing

% Localise shugoshin properly (i.e. between CENP-A islands)
% centromeric cohesin deposited by the kinetochore is important for the proper localisation of shugoshin, either through direct binding or chromatin structural organisation
% cohesin-depleted cells have coarsely normal Sgo1 localisation and are still capable of sensing tension
% possible test: shugoshin on extended chromatin

% provide mechanical property
% inter- vs intra- has long been debated
% Sgo1 is likely a signal transducer rather than tension sensor

% final test: manipulation of CENP-A spatial pattern -- in budding yeast, genetic engineer centromere, consecutive CDE sequences vs interspersed CDE sequences, see if tension sensing is affected. 

Big future directions of how centromeres and pericentromeres can be understood better by the types of approaches you had done in your PhD.
  -theory and experiment (pros and cons)
  -imbalance of theory and experiment in  biology and its damaging results (More theory is needed)
    -growth of literature full of data with weak interpretation
    -communication gap between experimentalists and theoreticians
    -work ethic: overly emphasise data collection over developing theory, rather than doing the right experiment, keep doing experiments blindly 
  -Incompatibility of theoretical and experimental work at the same time
