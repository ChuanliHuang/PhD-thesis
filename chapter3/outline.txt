3.	Characterizing the role of Bub1 and H2A-pS121 in tension-dependent re-localization of Sgo1 
3.1.	Introduction (Bub1, H2A-pS121, Nerusheva 2014, Su 2021, spatial)
        shugoshin
        shugoshin and tension sensing -- tension-dependent relocalization of shugoshin (human, mouse, budding yeast, potentially fission yeast kawashima 2007, fly); model for shugoshin in tension sensing
        regulation of sgo1 localization -- bub1 and pH2A importance for shugoshin localization (human, mouse, fission/budding yeast); cohesin; phosphatases
        previous models of tension-dependent re-localization and their drawbacks (HiC supports pulling model)
        bub1 and H2A-pT120 localization does not agree human model, no H2A-pT120 in hongtaoyu paper; yeast model Bub1 overexposed and no quantification; yeast model rts1d still lose sgo1 under tension; yeast model does not have H2A-pS121 ab
        whether cohesin is involved in yeast not known (ChIP-qPCR contradicts tension-sensing function shugoshin)
        to resolve controversy: look at bub1 and pH2A under tension; look for phosphatases
        controversy:
        pH2A (human: staining under no tension is incosistent; can't do ChIP; tension data contradicts model; yeast: no data )
        Bub1 localization (pulled away model vs delocalize model)
        phosphatase
        cohesin in yeast (localization vs function)



Discussion

cohesin is not required in frog/mouse/fly???
Residual Bub1 and pH2A on KT, residual Sgo1, potentially unified model across species
bub1 sgo1 CPC PP1 positive feedback
H2A-pS121 is redistributed when Bub1 localization is messed up
