3.	Characterizing the role of Bub1 and H2A-pS121 in tension-dependent re-localization of Sgo1 
3.1.	Introduction (Bub1, H2A-pS121, Nerusheva 2014, Su 2021, spatial)
        centromere function and spatial regulation; shugoshin re-localisation as an example; what is tension; what is shugoshin; tension-dependent relocalization of shugoshin (human, mouse, budding yeast, potentially fission yeast kawashima 2007, fly)
        shugoshin and tension sensing --; model for shugoshin in tension sensing
        shugoshin and chromosome condensation
        regulation of sgo1 localization -- bub1 and pH2A importance for shugoshin localization (human, mouse, fission/budding yeast); cohesin; phosphatases
        previous models of tension-dependent re-localization and their drawbacks (HiC supports pulling model)
        bub1 and H2A-pT120 localization does not agree human model, no H2A-pT120 in hongtaoyu paper; yeast model Bub1 overexposed and no quantification; yeast model rts1d still lose sgo1 under tension; yeast model does not have H2A-pS121 ab
        whether cohesin is involved in yeast not known (ChIP-qPCR contradicts tension-sensing function shugoshin)
        to resolve controversy: look at bub1 and pH2A under tension; look for phosphatases
        controversy:
        pH2A (human: staining under no tension is incosistent; can't do ChIP; tension data contradicts model; yeast: no data )
        Bub1 localization (pulled away model vs delocalize model)
        phosphatase
        cohesin in yeast (ChIP-qPCR contradicts tension-sensing function shugoshin)



Discussion
bub1 delocalization caused shugoshin removal rather than the opposite
cohesin is not required in frog/mouse/fly (not sure which one)
Residual Bub1 and pH2A on KT, residual Sgo1, potentially unified model across species
bub1 sgo1 CPC PP1 positive feedback (explain the fast removal of shugoshin)
H2A-pS121 is redistributed when Bub1 localization is messed up

to prove the final model: 1. tension has an effect on each step; 2. each step depends on last step
