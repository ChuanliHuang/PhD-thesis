3.	Characterizing the role of Bub1 and H2A-pS121 in tension-dependent re-localization of Sgo1 
3.1.	Introduction (Bub1, H2A-pS121, Nerusheva 2014, Su 2021, spatial)
        bub1 had pH2A importance for shugoshin localization
        previous models of tension-dependent re-localization and their drawbacks (HiC supports pulling model)
        bub1 and H2A-pS121 localization
        to resolve controversy 
        
        
3.2.	Results
3.2.1.	The distance between Bub1 and peri-centromere boarder is not correlated with tension
3.2.2.	Bub1 is re-localized from KT by tension (imagings + timecourse)
3.2.3.	Bub1 re-localization is earlier than Sgo1 re-localization (analysis)
3.2.4.	Bub1 removal is sufficient to re-localize Sgo1 in the absence of tension 
3.2.5.	Total H2A-pS121 level is independent of tension
3.2.6.	Tension redistributes H2A-pS121 from centromere to chromosome arms
3.2.7.	Sgo1 cannot be localized to peri-centromere in H2A phospho-mimic mutants
3.2.8.	Tension increases long-range in cis interactions
3.3.	Discussion
3.3.1.	Proposed model for tension-dependent re-localization of Sgo1
3.3.2.	Other factors might affect Sgo1 localization
3.3.3.	Sgo1 is a signal mediator rather than the tension sensor (Bub1 removal could be key to tension sensing; tension sensing machinery might monitor intra-KT rather than inter-KT tension)
3.3.4.	Re-distribution of H2A-pS121 is likely to link chromosome condensation to SAC silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
