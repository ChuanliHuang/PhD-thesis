\chapter{Investigating the Molecular Mechanisms of Tension-dependent Re-localisation of Shugoshin}

\section{Introduction}
Centromere executes its function of coordinating chromosome segregation partially, if not mainly, through controlling subcellular location of critical regulators. A remarkable example is tension-dependent re-localisation of shugoshin. 

Conserved shugoshin protein family is a versatile peri-centromeric adaptor that engages various effector proteins important for accurate chromosome segregation in both mitosis and meiosis \citep{Watanabe2005, Clift2011, Gutierrez-Caballero2012Shugoshins:Centromere, Marston2015, Zhang2020FunctioningMitosis}.

To be segregated into different daughter cells later, sister chromatids need to be bipolarly attached to the spindle in mitosis or in meiosis II, which is termed as bi-orientation \citep{Tanaka2010Kinetochore-microtubuleBi-orientation}. Bi-oriented sister chromatids come under 
tension due to the counteraction between resistance of cohesion and pulling of microtubules. Cells sense lack of tension to identify erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachment and delay cell cycle progression \citep{Nicklas1997HowChromosomes, Nicklas1994}. Location of shugoshin has been found to change in response to tension across species. Human Sgo1 and Sgo2 redistribute from inner centromere towards kinetochore upon tension establishment in mitosis \citep{Huang2007, Lee2008, Liu2013, Asai2020}. Mouse Sgo2 follows the same pattern in meiosis II \citep{Lee2008, Gomez2007}. In budding yeast, tension triggers removal of its only shugoshin protein Sgo1 from peri-centromere \citep{, Eshleman2014, Nerusheva2014, Paldi2020ConvergentPericentromeres}. Although effect of tension has not been directly studied, locations are different between metaphase and anaphase for \textit{Drosophila} MEI-S332 (mitosis and meiosis II) and fission yeast Sgo2 (mitosis) \citep{Clarke2005, Kawashima2007}, raising the possibility that they also undergo tension-dependent re-localisation. 

Re-localisation of shugoshin is proposed to be key to tension sensing \citep{Marston2015}. Screening in budding yeast identified Sgo1 being required to delay anaphase onset in the absence of tension \citep{Indjeian2005a}. Later, it was shown to be due to its role in preventing SAC silencing \citep{Jin2013TheAttachment}. Given the function of Sgo1 to support CPC localisation, it was reasoned that tension-dependent re-localisation of Sgo1 triggers the removal of CPC from centromere, leading to SAC silencing \citep{Nerusheva2014}. In support of this model, artificially tethering Sgo1 to the kinetochore caused prolonged metaphase \citep{Su2021SumoylationAnaphase}. In mammals, the re-localisation is thought to inactivate cohesin protection \citep{Lee2008}. Indeed, impaired human Sgo1 re-localisation increased lagging chromosomes in anaphase \citep{Liu2013}. Besides, at least in budding yeast, re-localisation of shugoshin might be the signal for chromosome condensation. The key condensation player condensin spreads from centromere to chromosome arms also in a tension-dependent manner \citep{Leonard2015}. As its interactor \citep{Yahya2020, Verzijlbergen2014, Peplowska2014}, it is possible that Sgo1 mediates the spread. Consistent with this idea, mitotic chromosome condensation is abolished in \textit{sgo1} mutant \citep{Kruitwagen2018}. 

The mechanism of shugoshin re-localisation is less well understood.
