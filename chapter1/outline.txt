1.	Introduction
General introduction (philosophy stuff, definition, history, mostly epigenetics nature, diversity)
1.1.	Form of centromere
1.1.1.	Genetics (different types; remember to mention CENP-B; Talbert 2020)

point cen
regional cen
holo cen

1.1.2.	Epigenetics (CENP-A history; CENP-A structural data)

cenp-a history
cenp-a structural data
cenp-a propagation in brief

1.1.3.	Kinetochore assembly (Marston 2022)

kinetochore subassembly II

CCAN subcomplex
CENP-C as blueprint
human and yeast CCAN are similar in structure
CCAN subunit depletion shows varied phenotypes

kinetochore subassembly III
kinetochore subassembly IV
kt and peri-cen chromatin structure

1.2.	Functions of centromere (Tanaka 2013)
main purpose is to execute segregation without error
promote capture (see other reviews)
force resistance (see other papers)
promote intrinsic bias towards bi-orientation
SAC & error correction
centromeric cohesion
early replication (yeast and more?)
chromosome condensation

1.2.1.	SAC and error correction (London 2014; Musacchio 2022; Lara-Gonzalez 2021))
helps attachment, avoid error (MT search and capture, corona; condensin)
mediates attachment (force resistance)
eliminate error if occurs (SAC)
1.2.2.	Cohesion 
centromere cohesion is important for proper segregation, both geometry and tension sensing
mechanisms by which centromere ensure local cohesion differ among species
1.2.4.	Chromosome condensation (Yves barral)
1.3.	Aims of this study
1.3.1.	Potential link between CENP-A spatial organization and tension sensing function (island->unit module KT->shape surrounding chromatin ->centromere spatial structure and mechanical property, use Hongtao Yu model as one possibility -> biochemical signalling->tension sensing)
1.3.2.	Aim1: Building a theoretical model for centromere spatial organization and propagation

The mechanisms by which cells control the number and position of CENP-A nucleosomes is unknown but likely important for the organization of centromeric chromatin in mitosis so that the kinetochore is properly oriented for microtubule capture.

1.3.3.	Aim2: Investigating the molecular mechanisms of tension-dependent re-localization of shugoshin (include the reasons of using budding yeast)


When first defining the term centromere in 1936, Cyril Darlington commented that “[the centromere must] be considered in terms of function rather than form, since the function is evident and the form elusive” (Ref. 10).
