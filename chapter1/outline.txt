General introduction (philosophy stuff, definition, history, mostly epigenetics nature, diversity)
1.1.	Form of centromere
1.1.1.	Genetics (different types; remember to mention CENP-B; Talbert 2020)
1.1.2.	Epigenetics (CENP-A history; CENP-A structural data)
1.1.3.	Kinetochore assembly (Marston 2022)
1.2.	Functions of centromere (Tanaka 2013)
1.2.1.	Error-free attachment to KT; SAC and error correction (London 2014; Musacchio 2022; Lara-Gonzalez 2021))
1.2.2.	Cohesion 
1.2.3.	DNA replication
1.2.4.	Chromosome condensation (Yves barral)
1.3.	Aims of this study
1.3.1.	Potential link between CENP-A spatial organization and tension sensing function (island->unit module KT->shape surrounding chromatin ->centromere spatial structure and mechanical property, use Hongtao Yu model as one possibility -> biochemical signalling->tension sensing)
1.3.2.	Aim1: Building a theoretical model for centromere spatial organization and propagation
1.3.3.	Aim2: Investigating the molecular mechanisms of tension-dependent re-localization of shugoshin (include the reasons of using budding yeast)


When first defining the term centromere in 1936, Cyril Darlington commented that “[the centromere must] be considered in terms of function rather than form, since the function is evident and the form elusive” (Ref. 10).
